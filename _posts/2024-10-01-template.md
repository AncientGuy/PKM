# We learn BEST when we learn by IMMERSION. 


It's NECESSARY to be overwhelmed, frustrated, ready to cry.

In fact, without that aggravation of being overwhelmed by something, our cognitive faculties atrophy.

Immersion is about being overwhelmed AND pushing it a bit, in order feel the eustress.

AI assistants help us learn IMMERSIVELY ... the following example of a prompt illustrates the process.

# The prompt for a syllabus for autodidactic study starts with a request for a year-long syllabus.

        Develop a 200-module syllabus to study the biology, chemistry, mathematics, neurology, endocrinology and kinesiology to give a solid theoretical understanding that make the development of capabilities through coaching much more efficient, reliable and sustainable. These modules should help the autodidactic superathlete to engage in a lifestyle that includes strength training, martial arts training, plyometrics such as heavy bag kicking or punching, as well isometrics of things like planks or pilates or body weight calesthenics and animal movement training. The modules should give the student practice in exercising to furnish the lessons learned from delving into the fundamental biochemistry and biophysics of nueronal action potentials. The modules should also include something about hydration and nutrition since this affects the biochemistry of the living cell; in other words, the course should also include cellular health topics such as the understanding the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components and what can be done to optimize cellular health for extreme fitness.


We take the results of from that prompt and then we tear it part critically as we read and research and then we re-factor and re-build a syllabus that is more comprehensive and more detailed ... it will typically take at least one hundred additional prompts to the AI assistant to help us put leaves on the branches of the tree.

MOSTLY ... it's about reading MORE ...**a LOT more** ... and then reading still more as we continually work at refactoring our notes ... in order to get a high-lever overview necessary to have a NOOB's understanding of the subject matter. ***THEN we start having conversations with people who actually KNOW, or at least CLAIM to know, different aspects of the subject matter.***

# READ more, MUCH MORE ... to build annotated bibliographies with notes from a wide a variety of sources as possible

**AVOID video and podcast sources, for the most part ... sometimes there's no substitute.** 

Wikipedia with ACTIVE notetaking, generally beats YouTube and passive watching any video. Especially if you enjoy watching videos, it's necessary to stop needind to be led by the nose through something like a video.

Read more, much more ... THINK about what you reading as you attempt to summarize what you are reading FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, **not just Wikipedia** to build annotated bibliographies with notes from a wide a variety of sources as possible ... as you begin to understand the lay of the land, ie after you have built these repositories and know enough to start being dangerous, start experimenting with hands-on experiments and projects to test your understanding and to build your own knowledge base. **THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS TO KNOW YOURSELF,** that means having greater awarness of HEALTH AND FITNESS ... body-awareness, social-awareness, emotional-awareness, cognitive awareness and particularly spiritual awareness.
