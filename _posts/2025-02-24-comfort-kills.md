*We all know about hormesis ... that which does not kill you makes you stronger.*

# That which does not make you stronger is killing you. 

I really enjoy watching onions, garlic, ramps grow IN EARLY SPRING, way before they look like they are thriving, just for their toughness and FIGHT under tough conditions ... that other wimpy plants like tomatoes, herbs or pansies LITERALLY behave like pansies ... and don't even try until several months go past and it gets all warm and toasty. It's the [allicin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6271412/) in alliums which makes'm tough ... provides the ridiculously strong antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, even against MRSA strains that make the best pharmaceutical drugs tap out.

Of course, alliums are also rich in prebiotic fiber for gut health and even contain essential minerals like selenium and zinc, because other plants don't need/absorb as much selenium or zinc. Without doubt, regular heavy consumption of alliums has been linked to onion breath and exuding a garlic essence ... which is what turns people off ... but it's the stuff that keeps unnecessary pests and parasites away. The benefits are most potent when alliums are eaten raw ... *like you would with a raw, freshly killed deer or some other animal you were tired of chasing.*

Onions ALSO provide a lot of flavor and stimulate a lot of different reactions ... which in turn support heart health by helping regulate blood pressure and cholesterol, while their pungent sulfur compounds [just like those from radish/brocolli sprouts] boost immune function and reduce inflammation. [Sulfur compounds work by activating Nrf2 pathways](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7663041/) - Both types of sulfur compounds trigger the Nrf2 signaling pathway, a master regulator of antioxidant response that activates over 200 genes involved in cellular protection. This modulates immune function or enhances natural killer cell activity, regulate cytokine production, and support T-cell function and inhibits inflammatory pathways which is about suppress NF-ÎºB and other inflammatory signaling cascades that drive chronic inflammation [of all kinds, notably the kinds of inflamation driving Alzeimer's Disease].

The pungency is indeed connected to their biological activity and plant defense mechanisms against predators and pathogens. The sharp taste and smell serve as warning signals to potential consumers. While not immediately toxic, they create a mild irritant effect that discourages continuous consumption by insects and animals, which represents a fascinating, but most elegant biological trade-off and lesson for us. The very compounds plants developed for protection have beneficial effects when consumed in moderate amounts by humans, demonstrating hormetic effects - the stress we survive triggers beneficial adaptive responses in our bodies.
