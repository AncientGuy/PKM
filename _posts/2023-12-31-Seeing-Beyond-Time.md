# The point of the AncientGuy essays are about transcending Time

Transcending time is about ditching the baggage of one's ego.

Seeing beyond Time involves realizing that the ORIGIN of all Origins is defined as God. This must be emphasize, God is matter of operationally DEFINING a word, eg Genesis 1:1, this is a matter of DEFINITIONS of a word not a matter of belief. 

It's not that God is *alive*, per se. God is the Creator of Everything, including Time. God IS Everywhere, throughout all time, but all at once. Life is an artificial, imperfect human concept constrained by the limitations of the human experience.  Of course, we have inklings that our understanding is limited that our notions of Everything is severely limited ... we can start to think about things like dark matter, blackholes, spacetime, timewarps, gravitation, electromagnetism, strong/weak nuclear forces ... but the human cognitive potential will always be severely limited as long humans remain bound by their own egos, their own thoughts, their own significance [as measured by others, in their own time or the time that human can contemplate, eg 5,000 years]. The Creator is not bound by Time or Space or human concepts of physical dimensions or concepts like attrative forces such as electromagnetic forces, gravitational force, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force.

God is not some nice Old Man, not our servant, not some superhero, not some anthropomorphized quasi-equal that'll will invite us up to the club so we can say we had steaks at God's place. 

In this Time-bound existence, humans are trapped by their egos, unable to escape the Timebound notions of their existence. 

Timebound humans cannot ditch their egos; thus, they unable to see why they must work harder at loving others as they love themselves, not simply as some commandment to do that without realizing why, but in order to escape the pathetic selfish timebound me-ness of their finite time-bound existence. 

The Creator always WAS, always IS, always WILL BE ... the Kingdom of Heavan is at hand, not something that is coming in the future. Luke 17:20

Your death is the only thing that is CERTAIN and certain to be coming in the future; embrace the FINITENESS of your lifespan and healthspan by attempting to make better uses of each second, ie work harder on improving your prayer life. 

Everything dies. Everyone you know will die OR they will see you die before they contemplate their certain death.

Everyone and everything that remembers any evidence of your existence or your species existence will die. 

Everything will return to the precursors of the Creator's dust. 

There is no such thing as genuine permanence in the manner that humans are able to concieve of permanence, because human thoughts are Timebound, therefore EGO-bound and entirely disposable ... the SOUL of the human is LOVED by God, but the EGO of the human is an impediment of the human's ability to accept God's love, to love ALL others as they love themselves.

## Thoughts on a Grand Theory Of Everything

What follows is a year-long 200-module syllabus for studying the thinking behind current research in the fundamental forces in physics; this include the more important attempts by humans to develop a Theory of Everything ... it is important for us to understand something about the latest and greatest thinking that is about explaining our physical reality.

This syllabus covers a wide range of topics, from the basic principles of the four fundamental forces to advanced theories that attempt to unify them. It includes in-depth explorations of each force, their theoretical foundations, and experimental evidence.

The course also delves into grand unification theories, supersymmetry, string theory, and other approaches to developing a Theory of Everything. It concludes with a discussion of current experimental frontiers and future directions in the field.

Throughout the course, students will gain a deep understanding of the fundamental forces that govern the universe and the ongoing efforts to unify them into a single, coherent framework. They will be exposed to cutting-edge research and will develop the skills needed to critically analyze and contribute to the field of fundamental physics.

### [Loop Quantum Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity) and Other Approaches to [Physics Beyond The Standard Model (BSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_beyond_the_Standard_Model) (10 modules):

[Physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22Physics+Beyond+the+Standard+Model%22&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-submitted_date&size=200) refers to the theoretical developments needed to explain the deficiencies of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), such as the inability to explain the fundamental parameters of the standard model, the [strong CP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_CP_problem), [neutrino oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation), [matterâ€“antimatter asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry), and the nature of [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) and [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy). Another problem lies within the [QFT mathematical framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) of the Standard Model itself which combines [classical field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_field_theory), [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity), and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics); the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity), and one or both theories break down under certain conditions, such as [spacetime singularities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity) like the [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) and [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) [event horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon).

Theories that lie beyond the Standard Model include various extensions of the standard model through supersymmetry, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), and entirely novel explanations, such as string theory, M-theory, and extra dimensions. As these theories tend to reproduce the entirety of current phenomena, the question of which theory is the right one, or at least the "best step" towards a Theory of Everything, can only be settled via experiments, and is one of the most active areas of research in both theoretical and experimental physics.

Despite being the most successful theory of particle physics to date, the Standard Model is not perfect.[3] A large share of the published output of theoretical physicists consists of proposals for various forms of "Beyond the Standard Model" new physics proposals that would modify the Standard Model in ways subtle enough to be consistent with existing data, yet address its imperfections materially enough to predict non-Standard Model outcomes of new experiments that can be proposed.
