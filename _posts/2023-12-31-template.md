# The point of the AncientGuy essays are about transcending Time

Transcending time is about ditching the baggage of one's ego.

Seeing beyond Time involves realizing that the ORIGIN of all Origins is defined as God. 

A matter of DEFINITION, not belief. God IS Everywhere. 

God is not some nice Old Man, not our servant, not some superhero, not some anthropomorphized quasi-equal that'll will invite us to the club so we can say we had dinner with God. 

In this Time-bound existence, humans are trapped by their egos, unable to escape the Timebound notions of their existence. 

Timebound humans cannot ditch their egos; thus, they unable to see why they must work harder at loving others as they love themselves, not simply as some commandment to do that without realizing why, but in order to escape the pathetic selfish timebound me-ness of their finite time-bound existence. 

The Creator always WAS, always IS, always WILL BE ... the Kingdom of Heavan is at hand, not something that is coming in the future. Luke 17:20

Your death is the only thing that is CERTAIN and certain to be coming in the future; embrace the FINITENESS of your lifespan and healthspan by attempting to make better uses of each second, ie work harder on improving your prayer life. 

Everything dies. Everyone you know will die OR they will see you die before they contemplate their certain death.

Everyone and everything that remembers any evidence of your existence or your species existence will die. 

Everything will return to the precursors of the Creator's dust. 

There is no such thing as genuine permanence in the manner that humans are able to concieve of permanence, because human thoughts are Timebound, therefore EGO-bound and entirely disposable ... the SOUL of the human is LOVED by God, but the EGO of the human is an impediment of the human's ability to accept God's love, to love ALL others as they love themselves.
