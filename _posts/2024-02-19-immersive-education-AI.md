# We learn by IMMERSION. 


It's NECESSARY to be overwhelmed ... without the aggravation of being overwhelmed, our cognitive faculties atrophy.

Immersion is about being overwhelmed AND a bit stressed ... it's not just about doing some trick in a hands-on fashion, but by not being able to function until we are proficient enough to know that we can survive, but don't quite know how to do it.


# The prompt for a syllabus for autodidactic study starts with a request for a year-long syllabus.

        Develop a 200-module syllabus to study the biology, chemistry, mathematics, neurology, endocrinology and kinesiology to give a solid theoretical understanding that make the development of capabilities through coaching much more efficient, reliable and sustainable. These modules should help the autodidactic superathlete to engage in a lifestyle that includes strength training, martial arts training, plyometrics such as heavy bag kicking or punching, as well isometrics of things like planks or pilates or body weight calesthenics and animal movement training. The modules should give the student practice in exercising to furnish the lessons learned from delving into the fundamental biochemistry and biophysics of nueronal action potentials. The modules should also include something about hydration and nutrition since this affects the biochemistry of the living cell; in other words, the course should also include cellular health topics such as the understanding the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components and what can be done to optimize cellular health for extreme fitness.

# READ more, MUCH MORE ... to build annotated bibliographies with notes from a wide a variety of sources as possible

Wikipedia generally beats YouTube ... stop needind to be led by the nose through something like a video ... read more, much more ... and then summarize what you are reading FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, **not just Wikipedia** to build annotated bibliographies with notes from a wide a variety of sources as possible ... as you begin to understand the lay of the land, ie after you have built these repositories and know enough to start being dangerous, start experimenting with hands-on experiments and projects to test your understanding and to build your own knowledge base. **THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS TO KNOW YOURSELF,** that means having greater awarness of HEALTH AND FITNESS ... body-awareness, social-awareness, emotional-awareness, cognitive awareness and particularly spiritual awareness.
