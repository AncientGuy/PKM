<p><em>"Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do every small piece of all of it for the glory of God." - 1 Corinthians 10:31</em></p>
<p>It took me forever to finally see this, but I slowly learned to see things like hydration as a matter of circulation and flow, in LARGER sense of life and the impact on spiritual fitness and ability to serve, rather than just pounding water to make sure there are ample fluids in my circulatory system.</p>
<p><em>These questions are designed for deeper contemplation, journaling, prayer, and gradual implementation. It's the pondering of complexities and paradoxes that matters in life, not the simple artless answers that crybaby dumbasses demand. These questions are not supposed to be easy to answer. One wants to develop better questions that force one to approach a topic as a matter of life-long journey of discovery rather than some menial task any AI can do, eg like dividing number by another with a calculator -- questions are not to be completed or answered quickly; questions are to be pondered. ALL aspects of health have similar insights for larger issues; this illustrates the total depravity of an approach to healthcare or life that is based upon easy button quick fix bandaid solutions or the need to make the problem go away immediately.</em></p>
