<p><em>These questions are designed to challenge conventional thinking about the relationship between physical and spiritual practices. Each explores genuine paradoxes that arise when seriously integrating biblical wisdom with modern understanding of movement, stress resilience, and physical preparedness. They invite deep reflection on the tensions between self-care and selflessness, strength and humility, preparation and trust, individual wellness and community serviceâ€”paradoxes that mature faith learns to hold creatively rather than resolve simplistically.</em></p>
