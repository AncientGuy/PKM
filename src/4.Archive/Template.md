# Archive Overview

*This landing page will feature a list of ongoing **ARCHIVES.** We will develop a template after we have experience with several examples.*

An **ARCHIVE** is a **PROJECT**, **AREA** or **RESOURCE** that's no longer relevant or useful. It might be something that is now deprecated, even discredited or a failure or a bad idea that we regret ever bothering with, but it does not matter -- we keep things in the ARCHIVE because they might be useful for informational purposes.

A Project is the start of a bigger development commitment and the basis of the P.A.R.A. method of the [*Building a Second Brain* (BASB)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/category/building-a-second-brain/) methodology. The BASB method systematically manages information differently than just notetaking apps ... **PROJECTS**, have goals, reqmts and deadlines ... **AREAS** are about roles/responsibilities or obligations or capabilities that need to be earnestly developed ... **RESOURCES**, mostly finished AREAS, but also ongoing interests, assets, future inspiration, may req continual maintenance and refactoring but, for now, are *backburner*able  ... **ARCHIVES**, inactive matl from P A R that shouldn't be used, except for informational purposes.

## GitHub Discussion, Issue, Project Functionality

We will rely upon the GitHub Discussion and Issue functionality, BEFORE graduating something to "Project" status ... when something becomes a Project on GitHub, it will simultaneously become a PROJECT in our P.A.R.A. hierarchy.

Please understand the GitHub progression from ... [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) ...to... [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/guides) ...to... [Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects).

Discussions are mainly for just discussing something, to clarify terminology or ask questions or for just generally speculative thinking out loud.

Issues are for things that somebody really needs to look into and possibly turn into more of a Project.

On GitHub a Project is an adaptable spreadsheet, task-board, and road map that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your teamâ€™s needs and processes.
