# 200 Reflective Questions on Stress Optimization

---

*These questions are designed for deeper contemplation, journaling, prayer, and gradual implementation. It's the pondering of complexities and paradoxes that matters in life, not the simple artless answers that crybaby dumbasses demand. Like koans, these questions are not supposed to be easy to answer -- the whole point to challenge conventional materialist thinking and instead of worrying about little problems or concerns or how we match up in our little world, we are to GROW UP and start attempting to learn, by beginning to discern God's will in our lives. Thus, one seeks to develop better questions that force one to approach a topic as a matter of life-long journey of discovery rather than some menial task any AI can do, eg like dividing number by another with a calculator -- questions are not to be completed or answered quickly; questions are to be pondered. ALL aspects of health have similar insights for larger issues; this illustrates the total depravity of an approach to healthcare or life that is based upon easy button quick fix bandaid solutions or the need to make the problem go away immediately.*
