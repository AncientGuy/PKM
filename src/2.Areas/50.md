# 50 **Pharmacology and Toxicology**  
Pharmacology and Toxicology investigate drug actions, mechanisms, and safety, including absorption, distribution, and effects on biological systems. Pharmacology focuses on therapeutic uses, while toxicology assesses harmful exposures and risk assessment. Together, they guide drug development, regulatory approvals, and environmental health protections.

* **Physiology**  
Physiology studies how organisms, organs, and cells function to maintain life, including homeostasis and responses to stimuli. It covers systems like cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine using experimental models. Insights inform medical treatments, exercise science, and adaptations to extreme environments.

* **Plant Biology**  
Plant Biology examines plant structure, growth, reproduction, and interactions with environments and other organisms. It includes photosynthesis, genetics, and ecology to address crop improvement and conservation. Research supports agriculture, biofuel production, and understanding climate resilience.

* **Scientific Communication and Education**  
Scientific Communication and Education focuses on disseminating research findings and teaching scientific concepts effectively to diverse audiences. It explores methods for writing, presenting, and educating in STEM fields, including public outreach and pedagogy. This area enhances science literacy, policy influence, and training of future scientists.

* **Synthetic Biology**  
Synthetic Biology engineers biological systems by designing and constructing new genetic circuits, organisms, and biomolecules. It applies principles from engineering and biology to create tools for medicine, energy, and materials. Challenges include ethical considerations, biosafety, and scaling up synthetic designs.

* **Systems Biology**  
Systems Biology integrates data from genomics, proteomics, and other omics to model complex biological networks and interactions. It uses computational approaches to predict system behaviors in health and disease. This field advances holistic understandings of organisms and personalized therapeutic strategies.

* **Zoology**  
Zoology studies animal diversity, classification, physiology, and behavior across taxa from invertebrates to vertebrates. It includes comparative anatomy, ecology, and conservation biology through field and lab methods. Research contributes to wildlife management, evolutionary insights, and biodiversity preservation.
