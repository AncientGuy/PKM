# 48 **Paleontology**  
Paleontology studies ancient life through fossils, reconstructing evolutionary history, extinctions, and paleoecologies. It combines geology, biology, and climatology to analyze morphological and molecular evidence. Findings inform biodiversity patterns, climate change impacts, and life's origins.
