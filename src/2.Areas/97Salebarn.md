Crowdliness -- connections matter, avg salary of one in 2M population city is 15% higher than 1M population city, largely because of connections -- while it is true that the urban wage premium is necessary to attract higher skills to places with a significantly higher cost of living, ie most spend most of the delta on higher living costs -- employers are not charities, ie they would use remote skill rather than pay more if they could to get the ends they seek, but it is the connections of local people [largely with their co-workers and colleagues from work] who make significant differences in productivity; moreover, remote skill is no substitute for the rainmakers in professions like law or venture capital.
