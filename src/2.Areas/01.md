### [1. Christian Spiritual Health](https://ancientguy.github.io/1.html)

As you improve your spiritual fitness, you will become much, MUCH less anxious ... long-term massive reductions in anxiety is one way of knowing whether or not your approach is working, ie it's NOT like the bs euphoria you might feel when you go to some EPIC retreat or have some life-changing experience, eg almost dying, -- it's a permanent, long-term MASSIVE reduction in anxiety ... and with freedom from anxiety, comes the ability to get off the damned hamster wheel and the ability to make smarter, more stable decisions and to do less blatantly stupid physical stuff, ie like use a drink to relax OR swallow food to be some sort of social/emotional crutch OR think that you need a vacation. 

#### The **REASON** that SPIRITUAL fitness matters more than all other forms of fitness combined is that the Creator is still creating ... GOD NEVER WENT ON VACATION and He never will. You were created in God's image ... that means embrace the SUCK, embrace the disappoint from humans, embrace the humility ... embrace being unappreciated or taken for granted, because humans CANNOT understand the nature of God.

That's what the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ was about. Christian spiritual health forms the cornerstone of holistic wellbeing, influencing all other aspects of life through prayer, scripture engagement, and spiritual practices. The questions explore deepening one's prayer life, developing meaningful scripture study habits, properly observing Holy Hour and keeping the Sabbath holy, and participating actively in Christian community in different ways. They prompt reflection on cultivating gratitude and worship as daily practices, serving others as an extension of faith, and embracing spiritual disciplines like fasting. The questions also address stewardship of resources, cultivating humility and repentance, and integrating physical wellbeing with spiritual practice. These reflective prompts encourage intentional spiritual development while recognizing the interconnected nature of spiritual health with other dimensions of life.
