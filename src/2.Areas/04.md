### [4. Nutrition](https://ancientguy.github.io/4.html)

The nutrition section examines dietary patterns and habits that have evolved throughout one's life while exploring optimal macronutrient balance and micronutrient intake for aging bodies. Questions address practical aspects of meal planning, preparation strategies, and hydration practices, alongside psychological and social dimensions of eating. The section covers environmental and ethical considerations in food choices, digestive health issues, and food sensitivities that commonly develop with age. Special attention is given to nutritional approaches supporting longevity and healthy aging, with practical implementation strategies for continuous improvement. The reflective prompts encourage approaching nutrition as an act of stewardship for one's body rather than focusing solely on restriction or indulgence.
