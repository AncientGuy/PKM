### [7. Rest, Recovery, Readiness For Service](https://ancientguy.github.io/7.html)

The sleep quality section examines sleep patterns, duration, and environmental optimization strategies that support restorative rest throughout aging. Questions explore circadian rhythm alignment, sleep timing considerations, and approaches for addressing common age-related sleep disruptions and disorders. The section addresses how daytime habits affect sleep quality, alongside the strategic use of napping and recovery practices when optimal sleep isn't possible. Special attention is given to psychological dimensions of sleep, technological influences, and integration with other health factors like nutrition and stress management. The questions culminate in developing a long-term vision for sleep as a spiritual discipline that honors God's gift of rest and renewal.
