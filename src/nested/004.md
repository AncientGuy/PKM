# [**Module 4: Automating Capture \- The Editorial Funnel**](./nested/004.md)


## **Deliverable:** 

Lay out the specifics of most rudimentary beginnings of thinking on an [automated information capture pipeline](./PIPELINE.md) that will eventually centralize external content into a dedicated inbox folder, ready for editorial review and integration into the main mdBook project.


## **Tasks:** 

In general, the assignment is to engineer an [automated information capture pipeline](./PIPELINE.md) to capture external information for potential inclusion in your book. Since mdBook lacks a direct clipper plugin ecosystem, the workflow will be more deliberate. Create a separate inbox directory outside the mdBook src folder. Configure tools like an RSS reader (e.g., Feedly) with IFTTT/Zapier or custom scripts to automatically save interesting articles, paper abstracts, or email newsletters as raw Markdown files into this inbox. This creates an "editorial funnel." The manual process of reviewing these drafts, refining them, and then consciously moving them into the src directory and adding them to SUMMARY.md becomes a key part of the engineering process, ensuring only curated content makes it into the final publication.
