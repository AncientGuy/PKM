# [**Module 4: Automating Capture \- The Editorial Funnel**](./nested/004.md)


## **Deliverable:** 

Start with [a GitHub Discussion on "Engineering an automated information capture pipeline for mdBook"](https://github.com/MarkBruns/PKE/discussions/1) ... then, after some rumination, selected the best approach, explain why minimalist approach was selected and open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MarkBruns/PKE/issues/2) ... and immediately upgrade this particular issue to a larger [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/MarkBruns/projects/6), to develop a roadmap ... and also explore the practicality of GitHub Discussion, Issue and Project functionailities, ie one Deliverable is only a meta-deliverable, just gaining experience using GitHub for this.

What is really needed, first of all, is roadmap that articulates or lays out the specifics of most rudimentary beginnings of thinking on an [automated information capture pipeline](https://markbruns.github.io/PKE/PIPELINE.html) after developing and using a minimalist pipeline in a more manual fashion, these tasks will eventually be automated in a way that centralizes external content into a dedicated inbox folder, ready for editorial review and integration into the main mdBook project.


## **Tasks:** 

In general, the assignment is to engineer an [automated information capture pipeline](https://markbruns.github.io/PKE/PIPELINE.html) to capture external information for potential inclusion in your book. Since mdBook lacks a direct clipper plugin ecosystem, the workflow will be more deliberate. Create a separate inbox directory outside the mdBook src folder. Configure tools like an RSS reader (e.g., Feedly) with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/feed)/[Zapier](https://zapier.com/app/templates/use-cases?query=rss) or [CRM pipeline tools](https://www.pipedrive.com) or custom scripts to automatically save interesting articles, paper abstracts, or email newsletters as raw Markdown files into this inbox. This creates an "editorial funnel." The manual process of reviewing these drafts, refining them, and then consciously moving them into the src directory and adding them to SUMMARY.md becomes a key part of the engineering process, ensuring only curated content makes it into the final publication.
