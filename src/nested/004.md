## **Phase I: The Developer's Knowledge Foundation (Modules 1-20)**

*Focus: Establishing a rock-solid, automated foundation for the PKM. This phase is about building the "scaffolding" and the core "DevOps" pipeline for your knowledge.*

### **Modules 1-5: Project Scaffolding with GitHub**

The initial modules focus on establishing the project's central repository, which will serve as the single source of truth for all knowledge, code, and configuration. This is the foundational step in treating the PKM as a formal development project.

1. **Repository Creation and Initialization:** A new private repository will be created on GitHub. This repository will house the entire PKM system, including Markdown notes, automation scripts, configuration files, and the mdBook source. Initializing the repository with a README.md file, a .gitignore file (configured for Python, Node.js, and Rust build artifacts), and a clear directory structure (/notes, /scripts, /book\_src) is the first task.  
2. **GitHub Projects for Meta-Tracking:** Before managing knowledge topics, the system must manage itself. A GitHub Project will be created to track the progress of this 100-day plan.5 This project will be configured with a Kanban board layout, with columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done".2 This provides immediate, practical experience with the project management tools that will later be applied to learning topics.  
3. **Structuring the 100-Day Plan as GitHub Issues:** Each of the 100 modules in this plan will be created as a distinct GitHub Issue.3 This modularizes the work and allows for detailed tracking. Using GitHub's issue creation features, each module can be documented, discussed, and managed individually.2  
4. **Custom Fields and Project Views:** The GitHub Project will be enhanced with custom fields to add rich metadata to each module's Issue. Fields such as "Phase" (e.g., "I: Foundation"), "Status" (e.g., "Not Started"), and "Technology" (e.g., "GitHub Actions") will be created.3 This allows for the creation of powerful, filtered views, such as a roadmap layout to visualize the timeline or a table view to group modules by technology.2  
5. **Establishing Branching Strategy and Workflow:** A simple Git branching strategy, such as GitFlow or a main-branch workflow, will be established. All work will be done on feature branches and merged into the main branch via pull requests. This enforces good version control hygiene from the outset and prepares the project for automated checks and workflows that trigger on pull requests.3

### **Modules 6-10: Mastering the VSCode \+ Foam Environment**

With the repository structured, the focus shifts to configuring the local development and note-taking environment. VSCode, augmented with the Foam extension, provides a powerful, free, and open-source platform for creating and navigating a graph-based knowledge base.8

6. **VSCode and Foam Workspace Setup:** The process begins by cloning the newly created GitHub repository to a local machine. Following the official Foam documentation, the foam-template project will be used to scaffold the necessary workspace configuration within the repository.8 This involves setting up the  
   .vscode/settings.json and .vscode/extensions.json files, which define the workspace's behavior and recommend essential extensions.8  
7. **Core Foam Features \- Linking and Graphing:** This module is a deep dive into Foam's core functionality. The focus will be on creating atomic notes—single files dedicated to a single topic—and connecting them using \[\[wikilinks\]\].9 Practical exercises will involve creating a few sample notes and linking them to observe how the knowledge graph is built. The  
   Foam: Show Graph command will be used to visualize these connections, providing a tangible representation of the relationships between ideas.9  
8. **Navigation and Discovery with Backlinks:** Understanding connections is a two-way street. This module will explore Foam's backlinking capabilities. The Backlinks Panel will be used to see which other notes reference the currently active note, providing crucial context and aiding in the discovery of emergent themes and relationships within the knowledge base.9  
9. **Installation and Review of Recommended Extensions:** The foam-template recommends a set of VSCode extensions to enhance the Markdown editing experience.8 This module involves installing and reviewing this list, which typically includes tools like  
   Markdown All In One, Prettier for formatting, and extensions for Mermaid diagrams and emoji support.12 Understanding the role of each extension is key to customizing the environment for maximum productivity.  
10. **Customizing VSCode Settings:** The default Foam settings provide a great starting point, but personalization is key. This module involves editing the .vscode/settings.json file to tweak the user experience. This could include changing editor fonts, setting rulers for line length, or customizing how wikilinks are rendered in the editor, ensuring the environment is perfectly tailored to the user's workflow.8

### **Modules 11-15: mdBook Configuration and Initial Build**

The next step is to configure mdBook, the Rust-based tool that will transform the collection of Markdown notes into a clean, searchable, and publishable static website.14

11. **Installing mdBook and Initializing the Book:** mdBook will be installed using Rust's package manager, Cargo. Once installed, the mdbook init command will be run within the /book\_src directory of the repository. This command creates the initial file structure for the book, including the src directory for content and the all-important SUMMARY.md file, which defines the book's navigation structure.14  
12. **Configuring book.toml:** The book.toml file is the heart of an mdBook project's configuration. This module involves a thorough exploration of its key options.15 The book's title and author will be set, and the HTML renderer options will be configured. This includes enabling or disabling section labels, adding a link to the source GitHub repository, and selecting a default theme.15  
13. **Structuring the SUMMARY.md:** The SUMMARY.md file dictates the table of contents and navigation hierarchy of the final website. This module will focus on understanding its syntax. A basic structure will be created, linking to the sample notes created in the Foam modules. This establishes the initial organization of the public-facing knowledge base.  
14. **Enabling and Configuring Search:** One of mdBook's most powerful features is its built-in, client-side search functionality. In the book.toml file, the search feature will be explicitly enabled and configured.15 Options like  
    limit-results, use-boolean-and, and boost-title will be explored to understand how to fine-tune the search experience for users of the knowledge base.15  
15. **Performing the First Manual Build:** With the initial configuration in place, the mdbook build command will be run from the command line. This compiles the Markdown files from the src directory into a static HTML site in a new /book directory. The resulting site will be opened locally in a browser to verify that the configuration is correct, the links work as expected, and the overall structure is sound. This manual build serves as the baseline for the automated pipeline to come.16

### **Modules 16-20: The First Automated CI/CD Pipeline**

This is the capstone of Phase I, where the manual processes of building and deploying are automated using GitHub Actions. This creates a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that ensures the published knowledge base is always in sync with the latest notes.17

16. **Creating the First Workflow File:** A new workflow file will be created at .github/workflows/deploy-book.yml. This YAML file will define the automation steps. The workflow will be configured to trigger on a push event to the main branch, meaning it will run automatically every time new changes are committed.16  
17. **Configuring the GitHub Actions Job:** The workflow will contain a single job, build-and-deploy. This job will be configured to run on an ubuntu-latest runner. The first steps within the job will be to use the actions/checkout action to check out the repository's code onto the runner.17  
18. **Installing mdBook on the Runner:** To build the book, mdBook must be available on the CI runner. The most efficient method is to download a pre-compiled binary from the GitHub Releases page, which is fast and avoids the need to install the entire Rust toolchain.16 A workflow step will use  
    curl to download and extract the mdBook executable.16  
19. **Building and Deploying to GitHub Pages:** The core of the workflow involves two steps. First, a step will run the mdbook build command, generating the static site in the /book directory. Second, a community action like peaceiris/actions-gh-pages will be used to deploy the contents of the /book directory to a special gh-pages branch in the repository.18 Repository settings will be configured to enable GitHub Pages and set the  
    gh-pages branch as the deployment source.19  
20. **Identifying the "Impedance Mismatch" and a Manual Workaround:** Upon the first successful deployment, a critical challenge will become apparent. The \[\[wikilinks\]\] used for fluid navigation within Foam and VSCode are not standard Markdown links and will be broken in the final mdBook output.8 This "impedance mismatch" between the authoring environment and the publishing tool is a central technical hurdle of the chosen stack. Foam provides a command,  
    Foam: Create markdown references for \[\[wikilinks\]\], which converts these links into a format that mdBook can understand.9 This module concludes by documenting this issue and establishing the manual execution of this command as a temporary workaround. This deliberate identification of a problem creates a clear and compelling motivation for developing a more sophisticated, automated scripting solution in later phases, transforming a potential frustration into a core learning objective of the 100-day plan.
