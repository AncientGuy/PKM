# Note Capturing Systems In Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)

The personal hyperlinked notebooks or wiki that are based on atomic notetaking as exemplified by [Zettelkasten (Zkn) Method](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) have revolutionized personal knowledge management (PKM) through [*ATOMIC thought* notes](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/), the ["folgezettel" principle of note connectivity](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/), and [a variety of emergent open source development communities built around Zkn](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/getting-started/get-involved/) and all kinds of [advanced Zkn PKM tools/plugins/add-ins, eg Zkn using the pomodoro technique](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/advanced/pomodoro/).

Of course, Zkn is certainly not the only the pattern in personal knowledgement system worth exploring. The principles underlying modern Zettelkasten implementations have deep historical roots spanning millennia of human knowledge organization and the innovations like Zkn in the realm of PKM will certainly continue and maybe proliferate even more now.  

Electronic note capturing approaches certainly matter, perhaps more than ever, in the world of AI, particularly for Human In The Loop (HITL) AI because data annotation adds important context, particularly as the human changes the approach of the AI ... so the development of note-**capturing** technologies become more important than ever, even as note-formating, grammar-checking and stylistic-prettification are things that be delegated to AI ... or "*Ship it* ...[*we'll fix it in post!*](https://mediaproxy.tvtropes.org/width/1200/https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/roll_camera_fix_it_in_post.png)"

As one might expect, there is a significant amount of ***current*** interest in the latest, greatest [***AI-assisted*** PKM tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1mqvte7/top_ai_knowledge_management_tools/), but the interest in PKM is not new -- it has been a really big deal for humans for at least 2500 years, ever since humans started using the printed word or moving beyond the limitations of storytelling and human memory which had limited the sustained development of knowledge in earlier philosophical traditions. The following comprehensive survey identifies 100 distinct systems across history and domains that share these core principles of idea generation, concept linking, and networked knowledge building. These examples span from ancient memory techniques to cutting-edge AI-powered knowledge graphs, demonstrating the universal human drive to organize, connect, and build upon ideas.

## Historical foundations: Pre-digital knowledge systems

### Ancient and classical systems

**1. Ancient Greek Hypomnema (5th Century BCE)** - Personal memory aids combining notes, reminders, and philosophical commentary for self-improvement and knowledge rediscovery, presaging modern reflective note-taking practices. Unlike the purely oral tradition that preceded it, the hypomnema represented the first systematic approach to externalizing memory for personal intellectual development rather than public performance. This innovation allowed Greeks to build cumulative personal knowledge over time, moving beyond the limitations of human memory that constrained earlier philosophical traditions.

**2. Roman Commentarii** - Systematic recording systems including family memorials, speech abstracts, and daily observations, creating interconnected knowledge repositories across multiple information types. While Greeks focused on philosophical reflection, the Roman system innovated by integrating diverse information types—legal, administrative, and personal—into unified knowledge collections. This represented the first comprehensive approach to managing different knowledge domains within a single organizational framework, surpassing the single-purpose records common in earlier civilizations.

**3. Chinese Bamboo Strip Systems (Shang-Han Dynasty)** - Individual bamboo strips containing single concepts, bound with cords and rearrangeable into different organizational structures—the ancient predecessor to atomic notes. Before bamboo strips, knowledge was carved on bones or bronze vessels in fixed, immutable arrangements that couldn't be reorganized. The modular bamboo system revolutionized Chinese knowledge management by allowing dynamic reconfiguration of information, enabling scholars to experiment with different conceptual arrangements and discover new relationships between ideas.

**4. Chinese Biji Notebooks (3rd Century AD)** - Non-linear collections of anecdotes, quotations, and observations organized organically, mixing diverse content types in flexible arrangements. Unlike the rigid, chronological court records and official histories that dominated Chinese writing, biji introduced personal, associative organization that followed the author's thoughts rather than institutional requirements. This innovation allowed for serendipitous connections between disparate topics, creating a more naturalistic knowledge accumulation method that reflected actual thinking processes.

**5. Japanese Zuihitsu/Pillow Books (10th Century)** - Personal knowledge accumulation combining observations, essays, and lists, representing lifelong intellectual development through writing. While Chinese literary traditions emphasized formal structure and classical references, zuihitsu pioneered stream-of-consciousness knowledge capture that valued personal experience equally with scholarly learning. This democratization of knowledge recording broke from the exclusively academic writing of the time, establishing that everyday observations could constitute valuable knowledge worth preserving.

### Medieval knowledge technologies

**6. Medieval Memory Palaces/Method of Loci** - Spatial mnemonic systems associating concepts with imagined locations, creating navigable knowledge architectures in mental space. While ancient rhetoricians used simple linear sequences for memorizing speeches, medieval scholars expanded this into complex architectural spaces housing entire libraries of knowledge. This innovation transformed memory from sequential recall into spatial navigation, allowing scholars to store and retrieve vastly more information than simple rote memorization permitted, essentially creating the first virtual knowledge management system.

**7. Medieval Manuscript Marginalia Systems** - Sophisticated annotation networks using symbols and cross-references, connecting main texts with commentary through "signes-de-renvoi" (return signs). Previous manuscript traditions simply copied texts verbatim, but medieval scribes innovated by creating parallel knowledge layers that could dialogue with primary sources. This multi-dimensional approach to text allowed centuries of accumulated wisdom to coexist on single pages, transforming static texts into dynamic knowledge conversations across time.

**8. Medieval Florilegia** - Thematic compilations of excerpts from religious and classical texts, literally "gathering flowers" to preserve and organize knowledge across sources. Unlike complete manuscript copying which was expensive and time-consuming, florilegia innovated by extracting and reorganizing essential passages around themes rather than sources. This represented the first systematic approach to knowledge synthesis, allowing scholars to create new works by recombining existing wisdom in novel arrangements.

**9. Ramon Lull's Ars Magna (1275-1305)** - Mechanical system using rotating wheels with letters representing philosophical concepts, enabling systematic idea combination for intellectual discovery. While previous philosophical methods relied on linear argumentation, Lull's mechanical approach introduced combinatorial knowledge generation that could systematically explore all possible concept relationships. This was arguably the first algorithmic approach to knowledge discovery, prefiguring modern computational methods by seven centuries and moving beyond the limitations of sequential human reasoning.

**10. Medieval Scholastic Apparatus** - Layered citation and cross-referencing systems connecting biblical texts with interpretive traditions through glosses and commentaries. Earlier biblical study treated scripture as isolated text, but the scholastic apparatus innovated by creating comprehensive reference networks linking verses to centuries of interpretation. This systematic approach to textual analysis established the foundation for modern academic citation practices, transforming religious texts into interconnected knowledge webs.

### Renaissance and early modern systems

**11. Commonplace Books (Ancient Greece-19th Century)** - Personal notebooks collecting quotes, ideas, and reflections organized by topic headings, emphasizing personal synthesis of external sources. While medieval manuscripts were typically copied verbatim, commonplace books innovated by encouraging active knowledge curation where readers selected, organized, and reflected on passages. This shift from passive copying to active synthesis represented a fundamental change in how individuals engaged with knowledge, making every reader a potential author.

**12. John Locke's Commonplace Method (1706)** - Systematic indexing using alphabetical arrangement with expandable sections and cross-referencing techniques for efficient knowledge retrieval. Previous commonplace books used simple topical organization that became unwieldy as they grew, but Locke's innovation introduced a scalable indexing system that could handle unlimited growth. His method transformed commonplace books from simple collections into searchable databases, solving the critical problem of information retrieval that had limited earlier systems.

**13. Polish-Lithuanian Silva Rerum (16th-18th Century)** - Intergenerational family knowledge repositories containing diverse document types, preserving practical wisdom across generations. Unlike individual commonplace books that died with their authors, silva rerum innovated by creating hereditary knowledge systems that accumulated family wisdom over centuries. This multi-generational approach to knowledge preservation was unique in Europe, establishing knowledge as family patrimony rather than individual achievement.

**14. Renaissance Artists' Pattern Books** - Collections of sketches, technical notes, and design concepts with cross-references between related techniques, supporting professional knowledge development. While medieval guild knowledge was transmitted orally through apprenticeship, pattern books innovated by codifying visual and technical knowledge in portable, shareable formats. This democratization of craft knowledge accelerated artistic innovation by allowing techniques to spread beyond traditional master-apprentice relationships.

**15. Islamic Za'irjah Systems** - Mechanical divination devices using Arabic letters to represent philosophical categories, combined through calculations to generate new textual insights. Unlike traditional divination relying on intuition or randomness, za'irjah introduced systematic procedures for generating meaningful text from letter combinations. This mathematical approach to knowledge generation represented an early attempt at algorithmic text creation, prefiguring modern generative AI by combining predetermined rules with combinatorial processes.

**100. Vannevar Bush's Memex** - Conceptual associative information system using microfilm technology and associative trails, serving as intellectual foundation for hypertext and modern knowledge management systems. Though never built, the Memex innovated by imagining mechanical assistance for human memory and association, establishing the conceptual framework for all subsequent knowledge augmentation tools. This vision of technology amplifying human intellect rather than replacing it continues to guide knowledge system development today.

## The universal patterns of knowledge work

This comprehensive survey reveals remarkable consistency in human approaches to knowledge management across cultures, time periods, and technological capabilities. From ancient bamboo strips to modern AI-enhanced knowledge graphs, successful systems consistently implement **atomic information units**, **associative linking mechanisms**, **emergent organizational structures**, and **iterative knowledge development processes**.

The evolution from physical to digital systems has amplified rather than replaced these fundamental principles. Modern implementations like Obsidian, Roam Research, and semantic knowledge graphs represent technological expressions of timeless human needs: organizing information, connecting ideas, and building upon existing knowledge to generate new insights.

Contemporary trends toward **AI augmentation**, **visual representation**, **collaborative knowledge building**, and **privacy-conscious local-first approaches** suggest continued innovation while respecting core principles of personal knowledge sovereignty and emergent understanding. The future of knowledge work will likely integrate these historical insights with advancing technologies to create even more powerful tools for human intellectual development and discovery.

These 100 systems demonstrate that effective knowledge management transcends specific tools or technologies—it requires systematic approaches to capturing, connecting, and cultivating ideas over time. Whether implemented through medieval marginalia, index cards, or graph databases, successful knowledge systems serve as **thinking partners** that amplify human cognitive capabilities and facilitate the discovery of unexpected connections between ideas.
