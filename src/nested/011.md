# **Module 11 of Modules 11-15: Skill Refreshment & Foundational Tooling**

* **Tasks:**  

  * [**Day 11 (Docker, containerization, setting up Python environments, k8s orchestration, buildah, cloudkernel, Modular platform, MLIR compiler frameworks)**](./nested/011.md): Create a standardized, but minimal Dockerfile build process for a data science container (Python, common libraries, PyTorch) to ensure all future projects are harmoniously pythonic and reproducible.  
  
* **Deliverable:** New mdBook chapters documenting refreshed mathematical knowledge, most likely using Python, but possibly also looking at the path for similar investigations with Mathematica and using Wolfram notebooks; a reusable Docker image for ML projects; and demonstrated proficiency in advanced Git workflows.
