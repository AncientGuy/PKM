# PROPOSAL for Transformative Discipleship Technology (TDT) Curriculum

**The FOCUS of discipleship is on unceasing prayer seeking communion with our Creator THROUGH HUMBLE SUBMISSION, not in showing off OR making noise and getting in people's faces OR evangelically conquering other humans.**

## Introduction
[Transformative Discipleship Technology (TDT)](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_daf31c5c-34d5-4fea-8ce1-54612595262a) is a self-directed, decentralized program designed to foster a deep, personal relationship with the Creator through constant prayer, scripture study, and reflective practices. It draws inspiration from the 12-step program and Celebrate Recovery’s eight principles, adapted for anyone seeking spiritual transformation free from centralized religious organizations. TDT addresses the challenges of addiction, affluence, and materialistic culture by empowering individuals to develop their own spiritual tools and practices, fostering a life of continuous communion with a higher power.

### Objectives
- Acknowledge and rely on a higher power for guidance and strength.

- Overcome addictions and materialistic tendencies through spiritual disciplines.
- Live a transformed life guided by the Creator’s will, sharing the journey with others.

### Structure
The TDT curriculum is structured as a 12-week intensive bootcamp, repeatable as needed, with four phases of progressive learning and practice. Participants can follow it self-paced or in small, peer-led groups. Each phase includes lessons, scripture readings, and practical exercises to build spiritual disciplines. The program is freely accessible, with open-source resources available online, and encourages participants to customize their spiritual practices.
