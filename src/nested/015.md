# **Module 15 of Modules 11-15: Skill Refreshment & Foundational Tooling**

* **Tasks:**  

  * [**Day 15 (Git workflows, GitButler branching workflows)**](./nested/015.md): Master advanced DVCS flow, complex Git/Jujutsu workflows, including GitButler and the role of semantic versioning and conventional commit messages.  

* **Deliverable:** New mdBook chapters documenting refreshed mathematical knowledge, most likely using Python, but possibly also looking at the path for similar investigations with Mathematica and using Wolfram notebooks; a reusable Docker image for ML projects; and demonstrated proficiency in advanced Git workflows.
