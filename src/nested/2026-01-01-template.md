# We learn BEST when we learn by IMMERSION. 


It's NECESSARY to be **cognitively overwhelmed**, *perhaps even so frustrated that we are ready to almost feel like crying!* 

Without that aggravation of being overwhelmed by some cognitive task, our cognitive faculties will atrophy. When we watch entertainment passively, it's not just that our faculties are atrophying, but we are being programmed to seek comfort, avoid learning new things and to *only IMAGINE that we think critically.*

# The syllabus for autodidactic study starts with by prompting an AI assistant for a year-long syllabus.

        Develop a 200-module syllabus to study compactification [or de-compactification] in mathematics and how this changes a theory with respect to one of its space-time dimensions.

We take the results of from that prompt and then we tear it part critically as we read and research and then we re-factor and re-build a syllabus that is more comprehensive and more detailed ... it will typically take at least one hundred additional prompts to the AI assistant to help us put leaves on the branches of the tree.

The following syllabus is an example of developing the result of the above prompt above.

## Compactification and de-compactification in mathematics and their effects on space-time dimensions

This syllabus provides a comprehensive overview of compactification and de-compactification in various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. It starts with the foundational concepts of topology and compactness and then explores different compactification techniques and their applications in analysis, algebraic geometry, and functional analysis.

The course then delves into the role of compactification in string theory, covering topics such as Kaluza-Klein theory, Calabi-Yau manifolds, and various string theory compactifications. It also examines the cosmological implications of extra dimensions and the interplay between compactification and quantum gravity.

The syllabus includes a discussion of dualities and their relation to compactification, as well as the application of compactification techniques in field theory and gauge theory. It concludes with advanced topics and future directions, such as the swampland program and the role of compactification in quantum information theory.

Throughout the course, students will gain a deep understanding of how compactification and de-compactification can alter the properties of space-time dimensions and influence the behavior of physical theories. They will be exposed to cutting-edge research in mathematics and theoretical physics and will develop the skills needed to apply these concepts to a wide range of problems.
