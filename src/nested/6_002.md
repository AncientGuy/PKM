# [Consecrating The Day](https://suno.com/playlist/76a16eb1-dd5b-4b81-a80e-7a07c771c0d5)

Generate eight 1950s-era cool beat-poet spoken-word lyrics for sparse modal jazz instrumentals for different thoughts that arise out of the contemplation of the following question, "***In your first moments upon waking, before the day's agenda rushes in, can you set a positive motivation, dedicating your actions to service and love, as a way of consecrating the day?***" I would prefer that each lyric have a Title based on its content and a Sub-Title that is a verse from scripture that inspires that content.

## 1. "Coffee Cup Cathedral"
*Sub-Title: "Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love" - Psalm 143:8*

Listen, man—
this morning light breaking through venetian blinds
like some kind of holy ghost fingers
reaching for my coffee cup—
and I'm thinking maybe
maybe this kitchen table
is an altar
and this first breath
before the phone rings
before the boss man calls
before the world comes crashing—
this breath right here
is my offering
my little rebellion against the machine
that wants to eat my soul for breakfast—
so I dedicate this day
this crazy beautiful terrible day
to something bigger than my paycheck
bigger than my hangover
bigger than my fear—
I dedicate it to love, daddy-o
to the cat on the corner who needs a meal
to the waitress working doubles
to every soul grinding through this concrete jungle—
because what else we got
if not each other?

## 2. "Dawn's Democracy" 
*Sub-Title: "Through love serve one another" - Galatians 5:13*

Dig it—
the sun don't ask permission
to paint the sky orange and pink
just does its thing
democratic-like
shining on saints and sinners
pushers and preachers
all getting the same light—
and here I am
consciousness creeping back
like Charlie Parker's horn
finding its way through the fog—
and I got a choice, see
I can wake up serving myself
or I can wake up serving
serving something real
serving the beat of humanity
that pulses under these mean streets—
every cup of joe I pour
every door I hold
every "good morning" I mean—
that's my vote
in the democracy of dawn
where love is the only candidate
worth backing

## 3. "Modeh Ani Mambo"
*Sub-Title: "I offer thanks to You, living and eternal King" - Modeh Ani*

Wake up wake up wake up—
soul returning like a prodigal cat
slinking back into this body
this beautiful broken vessel—
and the first word
before coffee
before consciousness fully kicks—
is thanks
thanks for another shot
at this cosmic crap game called life—
thanks for these lungs still pulling air
these eyes still catching light
this heart still keeping time
like Monk's left hand
finding rhythm in the chaos—
and I'm thinking
if the universe gave me back my soul
after all the stuff I pulled yesterday
then maybe
just maybe
I owe it something beautiful today—
some small kindness
some tiny revolution of tenderness
in this hard-boiled world

## 4. "Subway Sermon"
*Sub-Title: "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice" - Romans 12:1*

Man, this body—
this flesh and bone jazz ensemble
waking up to another gig
in the underground theater of existence—
and I'm thinking about sacrifice
not the blood and altar kind
but the everyday kind
the giving-up-your-seat kind
the sharing-your-sandwich kind—
because what's holy
if not the decision
made in that split second
between sleep and awake
to offer this day
this body
this collection of atoms and dreams
to something useful—
to be a bridge not a wall
to be a window not a mirror—
yeah, this body
stumbling toward coffee
is my offering
my beat-up beautiful offering
to the altar of human kindness

## 5. "Present Tense Paradise"
*Sub-Title: "Concentrate the mind on the present moment" - Buddha*

Here—
right here in this moment
before memory kicks in
before desire starts yapping
there's this space
this beautiful empty space
like Miles leaving notes out
making silence sing—
and in this space
I can choose
choose to dedicate
not yesterday's regrets
not tomorrow's worries
but this
this breath
this heartbeat
this now—
to love
to service
to the great cosmic dig
of being alive and aware—
present tense paradise
found in the gap
between pillow and purpose

## 6. "Gayatri Groove"
*Sub-Title: "May the divine light illuminate our minds" - Gayatri Mantra*

Light—
not the harsh fluorescent kind
but the kind that seeps
through closed eyelids
whispering wake up wake up—
and I'm praying
in my own bent way
for illumination
for the mental lights to flicker on
like a jazz club at dusk—
illuminate this mind
so I can see past
the headlines and the hate
the hustle and the hype—
show me the sacred
in the sidewalk cracks
the divine in the diner coffee—
because I want to dedicate this day
to seeing
really seeing
the light in every face
even the ones that forgot
they're carrying it

## 7. "Compassion's Chopsticks"
*Sub-Title: "Look at all beings with eyes of compassion" - Thich Nhat Hanh*

Opening these eyes—
these windows that could judge
or could love
depending on the prescription
I choose to wear—
and I'm making a pact
with the bathroom mirror
to see different today
to look at the world
like Dizzy's horn
bent toward heaven
finding beauty in the angle—
every cat I meet today
carrying their own heavy
their own hope
their own holiness—
and who am I
to look at them with anything
but compassion's chopsticks
picking up the broken pieces
with delicate precision
and infinite patience

## 8. "The Resistance of Yes"
*Sub-Title: "Be our strength every morning" - Isaiah 33:2*

Before the no's begin—
no time no money no energy—
there's this moment
this revolutionary moment
where yes still lives—
yes to love
yes to service
yes to the impossible possibility
that today could be different—
and I need strength for this yes
strength to resist
the gravity of routine
the pull of profit
the weight of why bother—
give me muscles for mercy
backbone for beauty
knuckles for kindness—
because saying yes
to love and service
in a world built on no
is the holiest rebellion
the most sacred insurrection
a one-man uprising
starting right here
in this unmade bed
in this unplanned moment
in this unexpected grace
of another morning
another chance
another yes
