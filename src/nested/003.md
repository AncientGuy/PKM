# [**Module 3: Tool Selection & Core Setup \- mdBook as the Core**](./nested/003.md)

* **Tasks:** Install Rust and mdBook. Initialize a new book project which will become your central PKES. Familiarize yourself with the core components: the book.toml configuration file, the src directory for Markdown content, and the SUMMARY.md file that defines the book's structure. This "publication-first" approach aligns with the goal of moving directly from notes to a shareable format. As part of this module, create an ARCHITECTURE\_ROADMAP.md chapter to brainstorm future extensions, such as building custom Rust-based preprocessors for mdBook to add new features (e.g., special syntax for callouts, dynamic content generation) or exploring high-performance stacks like **Modular's Mojo/Max platform** for future AI integrations.  

* **Deliverable:** A functional mdBook project, version-controlled with a private GitHub repository, and an ARCHITECTURE\_ROADMAP.md chapter outlining future development paths for the PKES itself.
