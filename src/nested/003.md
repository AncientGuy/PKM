# [**Module 3: Tool Selection & Core Setup \- mdBook as the Core**](./nested/003.md)

## **Deliverables** 

The mdBook project is now a minimally-functional work-in-progress at https://markbruns.github.io/PKE/ ... as such, it is version-controlled with a public GitHub repository at https://github.com/MarkBruns/PKE.

It includes ROADMAP.md chapter outlines the architecture of this specific PKE project itself, as well as the future development path outlined in the more intensive year-long CLOUDKERNEL.md development course for putting together pivotally-important  AI/ML ops infrastructure that PKES will be use as the base of all its development. 

## * **Tasks** 

Install Rust and mdBook. Initialize a new book project which will become your central PKES. Familiarize yourself with the core components: the book.toml configuration file, the src directory for Markdown content, and the SUMMARY.md file that defines the book's structure. This "publication-first" approach aligns with the goal of moving directly from notes to a shareable format. As part of this module, create an ARCHITECTURE\_ROADMAP.md chapter to brainstorm future extensions, such as building custom Rust-based preprocessors for mdBook to add new features (e.g., special syntax for callouts, dynamic content generation) or exploring high-performance stacks like **Modular's Mojo/Max platform** for future AI integrations.
