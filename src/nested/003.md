# [**Module 3: Tool Selection & Core Setup \- mdBook as the Core**](./nested/003.md)

## **Deliverables** 

The mdBook project is now a minimally-functional work-in-progress at https://markbruns.github.io/PKE/ ... as such, it is version-controlled with a public GitHub repository at [https://github.com/MarkBruns/PKE](https://github.com/MarkBruns/PKE).

It includes [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) chapter outlines the architecture of this specific PKE project itself, as well as the future development path outlined in the more intensive year-long [CLOUDKERNEL.md](./CLOUDKERNEL.md) development course for putting together pivotally-important  AI/ML ops infrastructure that PKES will be use as the base of all its development. 

## **Tasks** 

Explore the Rust ecoystem, particularly [Hermit OS](https://github.com/hermit-os) and various AI-aware Rust-based development communities to brainstorm future extensions, such as building custom Rust-based preprocessors for mdBook to add new features (e.g., special syntax for callouts, dynamic content generation).


### AI-Aware Rust-Based Development Communities for ML/AI Infrastructure

Rust's ecosystem is increasingly supporting AI/ML through its focus on performance, safety, and concurrency, making it ideal for infrastructure that enhances ML/AI operations (MLOps) in areas like speed (e.g., via efficient computation and unikernels), security (e.g., memory safety and verifiable code), monitoring (e.g., observability tools), robustness (e.g., reliable pipelines), and predictability (e.g., deterministic execution). Below, I list as many distinct communities as possible, drawn from active open-source projects, forums, and curated resources. These are "AI-aware" in that they explicitly target or integrate ML/AI workloads, often with extensions for GPUs, distributed systems, or MLOps tools. Each entry includes the community's focus, relation to ML/AI ops improvements, and engagement details (e.g., GitHub activity, contributors, discussions).

I've prioritized diversity across infrastructure layers: kernels/unikernels (for secure, lightweight execution), frameworks/libraries (for model building/training), tools (for MLOps pipelines), and meta-communities (curated lists/forums).
