# **Module 1: Defining the Philosophy \- From PKM to PKE**

* **Tasks:** The initial step is to establish a guiding philosophy. This involves learning about [why learning as an adult is so hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWdN2qVJZVQ) *or why the way that you were taught to learn in school is now irrelevant* because there is so much more new information to learn.  That includes how to use new technologies, like various different forms of AI, as aids to synthesize seminal texts on modern knowledge work. Critically analyze the distinction between methodologies focused on *resource management*, such as [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/blog/tiagos-2025-projects-questions-and-intentions/)'s [*Building a Second Brain* (BASB)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/category/building-a-second-brain/); Forte teaches these methods [using the CirclePlus community learning platform](https://circle.so/plus) to help subscribers excel at organizing information for project-based work, and [different, perhaps simpler or more personal, notetaking methodologies focused on *idea generation*], like [Niklas Luhmann's *Zettelkasten Method* (ZKM) for the hypertextual features of learning now](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), which is a notetaking system for working directly with ideas themselves. The BASB approach is explicitly project-oriented, speaking the "language of action," while the ZKM is project-agnostic, speaking the "language of knowledge". 

The specific assignment is to draft a personal "Knowledge Engineering Manifesto" that attempts to sketch out a roadmap that codify the principles for this 100-day endeavor, although it is likely that it will become something of a work-in-progress. The point of doing this is to establish a self-improvement discipline, in which one keeps polishing and circling back to re-cycle and update the skills picked up in this 100-day endeavor. This document should outline primary goals (e.g., "Learn a new technology stack and meet three new developers through a shared project"), core principles (e.g., "Default to learning in public," "Bias for action and rapid failure over perfect planning," "Prioritize connections over collections"), and success metrics (e.g., "Publish one new chapter per month," "Initiate three 'coffee chat' conversations with new contacts").  

* **Deliverable:** A [MANIFESTO.md](/Manifesto.md) file, which will serve as the first chapter of the new mdBook project. This document serves as the strategic charter for the entire system.
