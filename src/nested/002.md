# **Module 2: Architecting the Personal Library**

* **Tasks:** Design the foundational information architecture for your mdBook project. Instead of a freeform network, mdBook encourages a structured, hierarchical approach from the outset. Use the P.A.R.A. method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) as a conceptual guide to organize the top-level chapters and sections within your book's src directory. For example, create main sections for Areas (long-term interests like "AI Engineering") and Projects (short-term efforts). The Zettelkasten concept of atomic notes can be adapted; each self-contained idea or piece of research becomes a .md page within the book's structure, linked hierarchically in the SUMMARY.md file.  
* **Deliverable:** A defined folder structure within the mdBook's src directory and a METHODOLOGY.md chapter. This document will detail the rules for creating new pages, the strategy for structuring chapters, and the lifecycle of information as it moves from a rough draft to a published chapter.
