# [Walking With God](https://suno.com/playlist/f269c850-28f8-464a-babe-4f57c2b7ac62)

Poems, hymns lyrics help me reflect upon a focus idea ... I might start the process by prompting an AI to do something like: 

- Please furnish LYRICS, not a report. Generate eight 1950s-era cool beat-poet spoken-word lyrics for sparse modal jazz instrumentals for different Christian contemplative thoughts that arise out of the contemplation of the following question, "***When you walk today, can you practice walking meditation, feeling the sensation of your feet on the ground as a reminder of God's sustaining presence holding you up?***" 
- I would prefer that each lyric have a Title based on its content and a Sub-Title that is a verse from biblical scripture that inspires that content.


## 1. **Sole to Soul**
*"In him we live and move and have our being" - Acts 17:28*

Step... breathe... feel the concrete cathedral  
beneath these tired dogs of mine  
Each footfall a prayer  
each prayer a heartbeat  
against the pavement of His making  

The city hums its evening vespers  
while I walk this urban monastery  
Heel to toe, toe to heel  
in rhythm with the cosmic pulse  
that keeps the planets spinning  
and my blood flowing  

God's jazz is in the sidewalk cracks  
where weeds push through like grace  
unexpected, unstoppable  
reminding me that ground  
is holy ground  
when you walk it conscious

## 2. **Pavement Psalms**
*"Be still, and know that I am God" - Psalm 46:10*

Slow down, man  
slow it way down  
till each step becomes  
a meditation on gravity  
and grace  

The earth receives my weight  
like an old friend  
taking the burden  
redistributing the load  
through limestone and clay  
down to the molten core  
where fire meets fire  

Still walking  
still breathing  
still held  
by invisible hands  
that steady the unsteady  
that ground the ungrounded  

Listen... can you hear it?  
The silence between steps  
where eternity lives

## 3. **Ground Level Theology**
*"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it" - Psalm 24:1*

Every street corner is an altar  
every crosswalk a crossing over  
into deeper knowing  

My feet are making contact  
with six billion years  
of divine experiment  
Rock and roll, baby  
but make it sedimentary  
make it sacred  

The asphalt tells stories  
of mountains ground down  
of forests compressed  
of time itself  
poured and smoothed  
into this moment  
where sole meets soul  
meets God  

Walking meditation  
is just fancy talk  
for paying attention  
to the miracle  
of not falling through

## 4. **Concrete Communion**
*"Taste and see that the Lord is good" - Psalm 34:8*

Each step a small communion  
with the ground of all being  
Take, eat  
this is my sidewalk  
broken and poured out  
for your traveling  

The rhythm becomes ritual  
left right left right  
like rosary beads  
counted in shoe leather  
and worn pavement  

I taste the air  
thick with exhaust and holiness  
breathe in the city's prayers  
breathe out my own small alleluias  
while my feet keep time  
with the eternal metronome  

Stop... start... stop... start  
The stuttered rhythm  
of urban contemplation  
where red lights become  
invitations to prayer  

---

## 5. **Heel-Toe Hallelujah**
*"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news" - Romans 10:15*

These feet have walked  
ten thousand miles  
of doubt and certainty  
These feet have carried  
questions and answers  
in equal measure  

Now they carry me  
into this moment  
where walking becomes worship  
where motion becomes prayer  
where the simple act  
of putting one foot  
in front of the other  
becomes a proclamation  
of trust  

Good news travels  
at the speed of footsteps  
Gospel at two miles per hour  
Revelation in worn rubber soles  
making contact  
with the ground of grace  

Each heel strike  
a small resurrection  
Each toe-off  
a leap of faith  

---

## 6. **Pedestrian Prayer**
*"Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path" - Psalm 119:105*

The streetlights flicker on  
like votive candles  
in this urban cathedral  
where I walk my prayers  
instead of saying them  

My feet find the rhythm  
older than words  
the primal meditation  
of hunter and gatherer  
of pilgrim and wanderer  
of anyone who ever trusted  
the ground to hold them  

Step into the lamplight  
step into the shadow  
both are God's territory  
both require faith  
in the next footfall  

The path illuminates itself  
one step at a time  
like divine revelation  
or good jazz  
you can't see where it's going  
until you're already there

## 7. **Walking the Beat**
*"The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord" - Psalm 37:23*

I am walking the beat  
of my own heart  
synchronized with  
the deeper rhythm  
that moves the blood  
through cosmic veins  

Every step a note  
in God's long composition  
every pause a rest  
pregnant with possibility  
every turn a modulation  
into a new key  
of understanding  

The sidewalk under my feet  
is the bass line  
steady, reliable, true  
while my thoughts improvise  
wild solos overhead  
but always coming back  
to the fundamental truth:  
I am held  
I am carried  
I am sustained  

The beat goes on  
with or without me  
but I choose to walk with it  
to let my footsteps  
join the eternal percussion  
of grace upon grace

## 8. **Sacred Steps**
*"Wherever the soles of your feet tread, that I have given you" - Joshua 1:3*

This is all gift  
this pavement paradise  
this concrete promise  
this asphalt amen  

Every square inch  
of sidewalk  
is holy territory  
claimed not by conquest  
but by consciousness  
sanctified not by ceremony  
but by simple presence  

I walk therefore I am  
held by something  
larger than physics  
deeper than gravity  
more reliable  
than the rotation  
of the earth  

These feet are pilgrims  
this path is prayer  
this moment is monastery  
this step  
this single step  
is all the church  
I'll ever need  

The ground holds me  
like a promise  
like a prayer  
like the hands of God  
invisible but undeniable  
supporting each sacred step  
into the eternal now
