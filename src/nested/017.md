* **Tasks:**  

  * **Day 17 (LinkedIn & Professional Framing):** Revamp your LinkedIn profile to align with the "Practitioner-Scholar" persona, framing your career as a narrative. Perhaps publish a short article announcing the 100-day learning journey and linking to your newly deployed mdBook.  

* **Deliverable:** A live technical book deployed via GitHub Pages; a professionally framed LinkedIn profile; a curated list of target communities; a formal mentorship strategy chapter; and a detailed, actionable plan for Phase 2.
