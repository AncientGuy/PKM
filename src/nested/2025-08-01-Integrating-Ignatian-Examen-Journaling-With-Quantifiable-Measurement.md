If we want to improve our prayer game substantially, what topics should we be working on to better understand prayer, the understanding neuroplasticity of our brains to improve our execution and sensitivity during prayer. This is not limited to fasting and contemplative ascetic lifestyles that feature contemplation and prayer, but it is what we can think about as simply pray more ... not just maximizing the hours spent in prayer, but *"sharpening the [mental, biophysical] axe"* so that every minute spent in prayer is ***BETTER.***

As [part](https://claude.site/artifacts/e4cd5770-8f13-4e57-924d-e35216318d12) of an ongoing project that is about hippocampal neurogenesis and understanding neuroplasticity of prayer, fasting and contemplative ascetic lifestyles that feature contemplation and prayer, we can look at how we might use Ignatius Loyola's Examen process in our journaling to lay the foundation by applying some precursors of measurement theory, with an ultimate objective of something resembling a quantifiable approach [in a biophysical or neurophysical biomarkers] in our study of neurofitness and studying and improving the execution contemplative traditions.

## 1. Traditional Examen Components as Measurement Foundations

### Consciousness (Awareness)
Qualitative Markers:
- Depth of presence
- Quality of attention
- Frequency of distraction

Quantifiable Transitions:
- Duration of sustained attention periods
- Recovery time after distraction
- Heart rate variability during focused states
- EEG markers of attention states
- Pupillary response patterns

### Gratitude (Recognition)
Qualitative Markers:
- Emotional resonance
- Depth of appreciation
- Sense of connection

Quantifiable Transitions:
- Heart rate coherence during gratitude practice
- Vagal tone measurements
- Oxytocin level changes
- Facial EMG patterns during gratitude states

### Review (Analysis)
Qualitative Markers:
- Clarity of recall
- Depth of insight
- Pattern recognition

Quantifiable Transitions:
- Memory consolidation metrics
- Decision-making response times
- Cognitive flexibility measures
- Error recognition rates
- Pattern recognition accuracy
