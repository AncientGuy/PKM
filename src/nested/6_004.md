# [Not JUST Saying Grace](https://suno.com/playlist/dfd46d31-6831-422c-8b92-5a9acd38c1a2)

Poems, hymns lyrics help me reflect upon a focus idea ... I might start the process by prompting an AI to do something like: 

- Please furnish LYRICS, not a report. Generate eight 1950s-era cool beat-poet spoken-word lyrics for sparse modal jazz instrumentals for different Christian contemplative thoughts that arise out of the contemplation of the following question, "***Not just before, but DURING your next meal, can you practice eating meditation, chewing slowly and savoring each bite as a gift from God and a testament to the Creator's provision?***" 
- I would prefer that each lyric have a Title based on its content and a Sub-Title that is a verse from biblical scripture that inspires that content.

## 1. The Sacred Chew
*"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them"* - Luke 22:19

slow now, slow...
this bread between my teeth
is more than wheat, more than
grain ground down by stones—
it's resurrection morning
baked into golden crust,
each bite a small communion
with the One who said
"this is my body"
and meant it
every time we gather crumbs
from our ordinary table
and taste eternity
in the texture of His love

## 2. Gratitude Riff
*"In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God"* - 1 Thessalonians 5:18

dig it, man—
this carrot grew in darkness
pushed up through soil
and rain and time
just to end up here
on my fork, in my mouth
crunching like a prayer
orange and sweet
and I'm thinking
how the earth conspired
with sun and seed
to make this moment possible
this gift I almost
swallowed without noticing
but now I'm thanking
the dirt, the rain,
the God who orchestrated
this vegetable symphony
for my ungrateful tongue

## 3. Wilderness Provision
"*And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium*" - Numbers 11:7

what is it? what is it?
that's what they asked
when heaven's bread fell
like dewdrops in the dawn
and here I am
asking the same question
over my rice bowl—
what is this sustenance
that appears on my table
day after day
without my deserving?
each grain a small miracle
I chew slowly now
tasting the mystery
of daily provision
manna still falling
if I have eyes to see

## 4. Taste and See
"*O taste and see that the Lord is good*" - Psalm 34:8

the psalmist knew something
about flavor being revelation
about sweetness as theology
so I'm letting this honey
linger on my tongue
amber liquid light
made by bees who never
read scripture but somehow
understood the assignment
to transform flower nectar
into liquid gold
and now it's coating
my morning toast
and I'm tasting
and seeing
that goodness has texture
has weight has presence
has a way of making
belief delicious

## 5. Our Daily Jazz
"*Give us this day our daily bread*" - Matthew 6:11

this day, this bread
not yesterday's stale worry
not tomorrow's anxious hunger
but this moment's provision
warm in my hands
this prayer made edible
Lord's Prayer improvisation
where each bite becomes
"give us" and "this day"
and "daily" and "bread"
scattered across my palate
like jazz notes finding
their way home
to the base line
of divine sustenance
one chew at a time

## 6. The Multiplication Meditation
"*And they did all eat, and were filled*" - Matthew 14:20

five loaves, two fish
five thousand souls
and somehow
there was enough
always enough
when blessed hands
broke the bread
and here I sit with my single sandwich
feeling the echo
of that miracle multiplication
each bite expanding
in my mouth like
love made tangible
wondering if I eat
with the same gratitude
as those who sat
on grass that day
and tasted impossible provision

## 7. Table Fellowship
"*And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it*" - Luke 24:30

they didn't recognize him
until the breaking
until the blessing
until familiar hands
made sacred gestures
over ordinary bread
and maybe that's why
I'm learning to slow down
at my own table
to let each meal become
a possibility for recognition
for eyes opening
for "isn't this the One
who feeds us still?"
in every shared bite
every savored moment
every "thank you" whispered
over soup growing cold

## 8. Sabbath Sustenance
"*And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath*" - Exodus 16:23

no gathering today
no anxious reaching
for tomorrow's portion
just this meal
this moment
this rhythm of rest
even in eating
especially in eating
letting each bite be
a sabbath unto itself
unhurried, unworried
trusting that provision
comes not from my striving
but from the One
who spreads tables
in wilderness places
and calls us to sit
and taste the goodness
of not having to earn
our daily bread
