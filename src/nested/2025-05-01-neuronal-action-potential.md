We TRAIN about as hard as we can, then we rest and recover ... during the rest and recovery, we ACTIVELY, never passively, study the theoretical basis of the training that we are doing. 

ACTIVE study involves READING and critical thinking; it generally involves actually working out ideas in a papers-with-code-and-data approach OR if it's something like a solo drill, we roll through it focusing ONLY on getting the form right. There are exceptions, of course, but we generally eschew most use of video or anything that LEADS us by the nose as we sit passively watching the content ... the point is that want to be MENTALLY and even PHYSICALLY ACTIVE in our study, never passive or merely relaxing.

We could use different schedules for the off-day reading and study of the theoretical basis of our training regimen ... but it might be useful at first, just to develop different schedules, before DIVING IN DEEPLY into any one particular topic. Below, we see one possible year-long 200-module syllabus for studying the science underpinning the training approach; the point of this syllabus is to **intelligently** develop superathlete capabilities as efficiently as can. 

It is not necessary to complete this syllabus in order ... at first we might just try to skim over it and to attempt to refactor the code, revise the priorities and better understand over the course of a year, where/how we should be allocating our time to BEST spend our off-days or rest days diving deeping a particular module.  

The point of the overall syllabus is just to give an approximate allocation of time to a topic throughout the year. In something like ***Cell Biology and Organelles***, for example, we will want to spend four training off-days of the year OR 1/50th of our time, approximately one week, totally immersing ourselves in EVERYTHING that we can possible learn on ***Cell Biology and Organelles*** ... at first, we might just spend 15 minutes or so on each module, just to get a feel for the topic, before we completely skim through the entire syllabus, in order to revise the time allocations and replan the next revision of the syllabus ... on the 2nd rev, we might increase to 30 minutes per module and then revise the syllabus again.

Our point in working through this material, while gradually increase the depth of study is that our intention is using recovery time [between active physical training] to study the fundamental basis of nueronal action potential that we attempt to build with repetitions and muscle memory to achieve speed and effectiveness ... we want to work on generally improving this syllabus to always be training smarter, even smarter and still more even smarter:

An [action potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential) occurs when the [membrane potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential) of a specific [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) rapidly rises and falls. This [depolarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depolarization) or hypopolarization is a change within a cell, during which the cell undergoes an instaneous shift in [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge) distribution, resulting in less negative charge inside the cell compared to the outside, which then immediately causes adjacent locations to similarly depolarize. The instantaneous depolarization is essential to the function of many cells, communication between cells, and the overall [physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology) of an organism. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include such as [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron), muscle cells and certain endocrine cells such as pancreatic beta cells and certain cells of the anterior pituitary gland are also [excitable cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential#Cell_excitability).

### 67-70: Proprioception and Kinesthetic Awareness

JUST DO IT **RIGHT** ... just do it **RIGHT** ... there's NO REASON to just do it; you MUST just do it  **RIGHT**. JUST DO IT **RIGHT** is the motto that should be used; whereas the motto *just do it* is a marketing slogan used to sell shit to losers. Doing exercises in the kinesthetic **CORRECT** manner is NECESSARY because it not only safer, but perhaps even more importantly doing RIGHT and building the habit of doing it RIGHT is more effective approach ... after we have the kinesthetic habit DOWN, then we can and should *just do it* ... but we will always need to work on body awareness and mindful [proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception). Mindful [proprioception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception) is the basis of adaptivity; humans can adapt to almost anything because they have [phenotypic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity) IN SPADES; probably to a much greater degree than other animals. [Phenotypic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity)refers to some of the changes in an organism's behavior, morphology and physiology that happen in [hormetic response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis) to a different environment. It is fundamental to the way in which organisms cope with environmental variation. [phenotypic plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity) encompasses ALL of the different types of environmentally-induced adaptations (e.g. morphological, physiological, behavioural, phenological) that may or may not be permanent throughout an individual's lifespan. The basic principles of strength training take advantage of artificially, but intentionally-induced extreme changes in resistance that are overcome by the muscles of an athlete's body. The change is simple in that involves increasing the dosage of resistance by repeated [hormetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis) overloading of a group of muscles, typically by contracting the muscles under heavy resistance and returning to the start position for several repetitions until failure. Different strength and conditioning coaches will all use some variation on this basic method of resistance training which exploits the principle of progressive overload, in which the muscles are completely overloaded to failure, but in a way that does not injure the athlete, by working against as high resistance as they are capable of. As the muscle rest for a day or so, the muscles respond by growing larger and stronger. It is terribly important that beginning strength-training athletes or beginning martial-artists or beginners in any form of exercise that involves a hormetic response **start** with the NECESSARY process of just doing it RIGHT first ... at first, this a matter of just getting the form right, just developing the habits of [proper form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training#Proper_form) WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE, until the basic mechanics are flawless. Training the neurological aspects of strength or [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory) set the stage for the ability of the brain to instaneously generate a rate of neuronal action potentials that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle's potential. Failing to work first on proper form or cheating in any manner [such as doing the exercise wrong OR doping or using excessive painkillers] is more likely to result in injury and certain to produce less than optimal results from an exercise program as the levels of resistance are increased.

The modular structure allows for a systematic exploration of each topic, with an emphasis on integrating theoretical knowledge with practical skills and personal experimentation.

Throughout the course, students will gain a deep understanding of the biological and physiological mechanisms underlying human performance, as well as the tools and techniques for optimizing their own training and development. The inclusion of topics such as cellular health, nutrition, and mental preparation underscores the holistic nature of the superathlete lifestyle.

By engaging with this comprehensive syllabus, the autodidactic student will be well-equipped to design and implement effective training programs, adapt to various physical challenges, and pursue a path of continuous growth and self-improvement. The knowledge and skills acquired through this course will not only enhance athletic performance but also contribute to overall health, resilience, and longevity.
