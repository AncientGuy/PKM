# [Breath as Prayer](https://suno.com/playlist/350c33f2-a2df-4e9c-a2aa-e22ebdb78ed8)

How can the simple, rhythmic act of breathing become a wordless prayer, acknowledging the Spirit who gives life with every inhalation and releasing anxieties with every exhalation?

## 1. "Pneuma Cool"
*Subtitle: Genesis 2:7 - "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life"*

dig it, cats—
this original riff,
the first cosmic inhale
when the clay got hip
to being alive,
man, that divine breath
still cycling through
these lungs,
these ribs expanding
like the universe,
contracting like
a prayer returning home


## 2. "Anxiety Split"
*Subtitle: Philippians 4:6-7 - "do not be anxious about anything"*

exhale the worry, daddy-o
let it flow out slow
like smoke from a midnight cigarette
in some dim-lit joint
where the bass walks
and troubles dissolve—
breathe out the tight chest
the clenched jaw
release, release, release
into that groovy peace
that passeth understanding


## 3. "Every Breath Psalm"
*Subtitle: Psalm 150:6 - "Let everything that has breath praise the Lord"*

hey, you breathing?
then you're praising, jack
every inhale's a hallelujah
that don't need no dictionary
to translate—
the lungs know the score
they're playing this ancient tune
in-out, in-out
like brushes on a snare
keeping time with eternity


## 4. "Wind Knows Where"
*Subtitle: John 3:8 - "The wind blows where it wishes"*

spirit wind blows through
these borrowed bones
can't pin it down, man
can't make it stay
but it visits
oh, it visits
filling empty spaces
between the ribs
between the thoughts
between the now
and the next now


## 5. "Selah Pause"
*Subtitle: Psalm 46:10 - "Be still and know that I am God"*

sometimes the holiest thing
is the pause between breaths—
that suspended moment
when you're neither taking nor giving
just being, baby
just hanging in the void
like a rest in the music
where God lives
in the silence
between the notes


## 6. "Ruach Blues"
*Subtitle: Ezekiel 37:9 - "breath, come from the four winds"*

from north south east west
the breath gathers its cool
sliding into these dry bones
making them dance again—
each inhale a resurrection
small as a mustard seed
but dig how it grows
into this moment
this NOW
this undeniable alive


## 7. "Temple Tempo"
*Subtitle: 1 Corinthians 6:19 - "your body is a temple"*

this body's a sacred space, cat
and breath is the incense
rising, falling
filling the sanctuary
with its wordless worship—
no stained glass needed
when lungs become windows
letting the light in
letting the darkness out
keeping the eternal tempo


## 8. "Return Journey"
*Subtitle: Ecclesiastes 12:7 - "the breath returns to God who gave it"*

someday this breath
will take its last trip
back to the source, jack
but until then—
each exhale's a practice run
a little death
a little letting go
teaching us the rhythm:
receive, release
receive, release
the oldest song
the coolest prayer
