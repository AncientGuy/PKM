# Best Practices In Context Engineering

The *problem* with AI is that it's fantastic at tightly-scoped tasks, like winning at chess or go OR even at something like folding proteins, but it struggles immensely in defining the *context* and appropriate scope of the task -- this should come as no surprise, the biggest problem in managing or leading software engineering teams is also scope management or requirements management and not simply adding another neato feature because it seems cool. 

DISCIPLINE and telling AI to knock it the fuck off is where context engineering comes in. Context engineering is the practice of designing and managing the information provided to large language models (LLMs) to ensure that they don't squander their CPU/memory resources, so that they can effectively, expeditiously FINISH performing tasks. Drawing boundaries or providing TIGHT CONTEXT involves curating, structuring, [**annotating information and notifying relevant parties to be aware of developments in an area of knowledge relevant to them**](https://annotify.app) to optimize LLM performance, going beyond simple goofbutt prompt crafting.

- The term "context engineering" is gaining traction over "prompt engineering," reflecting its broader scope, though some argue it overlaps with intent or communication engineering.

**What is Context Engineering?**
Context engineering is the practice of designing and managing the information provided to LLMs to ensure they can effectively perform tasks. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting specific instructions, context engineering involves dynamically assembling relevant data, tools, and formats to create a comprehensive context window. This process is critical for complex AI applications, such as agentic systems, where LLMs need to handle long-running tasks or integrate with external tools.

**Why It Matters**
As LLMs become more powerful, their ability to process and utilize context determines their effectiveness. Poorly managed context can lead to irrelevant or incorrect outputs, while well-engineered context can transform an LLM into a highly capable assistant. This is particularly important in industrial applications where tasks require specific, often organizationally unique, information.

**Core Practices**
- **Track Token Usage**: Monitor and manage token consumption to optimize costs and performance.
- **Structure Context**: Use schemas to organize data, ensuring only relevant information is included.
- **Compress Data**: Summarize outputs from tools to keep context manageable.
- **Implement Memory**: Use simple memory systems to track and update agent states.
- **Leverage Multi-Agent Systems**: Employ multiple agents for parallel tasks to enhance efficiency.
- **Dynamic Context Assembly**: Build systems that adaptively fetch and format context from various sources.

**Relevant Research**
Recent studies, such as those on arXiv, explore scaling context lengths and attributing model outputs to specific context parts, offering tools to refine context engineering practices. These findings suggest that with proper data engineering, LLMs can handle extended contexts, improving their utility in real-world applications.
