# ##Module 10 of Modules 7-10: The AI-Powered Research Assistant**

* **Tasks:**  

   * **Day 10 [(Building the Research Dashboard)](./nested/010.md):** Create a Research Dashboard.md chapter in your mdBook. Since there's no dynamic plugin like Dataview, write a simple Python or shell script that scans your inbox directory for new files or files with a \#summarize tag in their frontmatter, and generates a summary list. This script can be run manually to update the dashboard page.  

* **Deliverable:** A semi-automated system for identifying, capturing, summarizing, and tracking relevant scientific literature, feeding a structured editorial pipeline for your knowledge book.
