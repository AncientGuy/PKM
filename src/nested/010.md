# ##Module 10 of Modules 7-10: The AI-Powered Research Assistant**


## **Deliverable:** 

A [Research Dashboard](RESEARCH_DASHBOARD.md) for coordinating a semi-automated system for identifying, capturing, summarizing, and tracking relevant scientific literature, feeding a structured editorial pipeline for your knowledge book.

## **Tasks:**  

   * Create the [Research Dashboard](RESEARCH_DASHBOARD.md) chapter in your mdBook. Since there's no dynamic plugin like Dataview, write a simple Python or shell script that scans your inbox directory for new files or files with a \#summarize tag in their frontmatter, and generates a summary list. This script can be run manually to update the dashboard page.
