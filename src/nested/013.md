# **Module 13 of Modules 11-15: Skill Refreshment & Foundational Tooling**

* **Tasks:**  
  
  * [**Day 13 (Mathematica Deep Dive, complement Pythoic ecosystem)**](./nested/013.md): Refresh foundational math concepts (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability) using Wolfram Mathematica. Create dedicated notebooks and export key visualizations and formulas as images to be embedded in new chapters of your mdBook; in the future this might involve extending mdBook or GitHub Actions to develop a seamless "write, commit, publish" workflow.  

* **Deliverable:** New mdBook chapters documenting refreshed mathematical knowledge, most likely using Python, but possibly also looking at the path for similar investigations with Mathematica and using Wolfram notebooks; a reusable Docker image for ML projects; and demonstrated proficiency in advanced Git workflows.
