# **Module 5 of Modules 5-6: Building the Public Face** \- **GitHub and HuggingFace**

## **Deliverable**

 Interconnected, professional profiles on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkBruns) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/MarkBruns) that serve as the primary public interfaces for the knowledge and artifacts generated by the PKES.

* **Tasks:**  

  * [**Day 5 (GitHub)**](./nested/005.md): Treat the GitHub profile as a professional landing page. Overhaul the profile README.md to be a dynamic "brag document". Create distinct sections: "Current Focus," "Core Competencies," "Open Source Contributions," and "Let's Connect." Link prominently to your mdBook (once public), LinkedIn, and Hugging Face profile ... leading to the interconnected, professional profiles on GitHub and Hugging Face that serve as the primary public interfaces for the knowledge and artifacts generated by the PKES ... ideally the GitHub profile README would pull from PKE repos such as https://github.com/MarkBruns/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced that were config'd to produce something like https://dw-dengwei.github.io/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced/
