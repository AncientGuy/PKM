# **Module 5 of Modules 5-6: Building the Public Face** \- **GitHub and HuggingFace**

* **Tasks:**  

  * [**Day 5 (GitHub)**](./nested/005.md): Treat the GitHub profile as a professional landing page. Overhaul the profile README.md to be a dynamic "brag document".\[10\] Create distinct sections: "Current Focus," "Core Competencies," "Open Source Contributions," and "Let's Connect." Link prominently to your mdBook (once public), LinkedIn, and Hugging Face profile.  

* **Deliverable:** Interconnected, professional profiles on GitHub and Hugging Face that serve as the primary public interfaces for the knowledge and artifacts generated by the PKES.
