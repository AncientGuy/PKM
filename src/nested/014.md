* **Tasks:**  

  * [**Day 14 (Git commands, GitHub, advanced Git, Jujutsu)**](./nested/014.md): Review basic Git commands including GitHub Actions, essential for open-source collaboration: interactive rebasing, cherry-picking, submodules.    

* **Deliverable:** New mdBook chapters documenting refreshed mathematical knowledge, most likely using Python, but possibly also looking at the path for similar investigations with Mathematica and using Wolfram notebooks; a reusable Docker image for ML projects; and demonstrated proficiency in advanced Git workflows.
