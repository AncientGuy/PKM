# Community Development To Improve Context Engineering

Context engineering success in this project depends on having engaged humans actively shaping the data that improves our retrieval augmented generative AI processes.

It's time we seriously consider growth and our next big step: bringing our [*faith-driven wholistic fitness digital strategy*](https://g.co/gemini/share/caaa98270bf1) to the digital highway. This means diving deeper into social media—transitioning from passive scrolling through friends' posts to actively managing our presence and using CRM tools to build our community.

Effective REAL, strategic social media management involves crafting a solid strategy and genuinely connecting with our audience, which will inevitably influence how our project evolves. This won't happen automatically—we need to take ownership of sustaining that engagement, probably through [a digital platform with integrated CRM functionality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJKVhCVOHsoVTt5EzLs_iIK1sLWsvE019-yINkj2aXk/edit?usp=sharing) to support our mission-focused community building and relationship development.

As a START for thinking about this next phase of our project, an AI was prompted to:

- Establish a baseline understanding of tools for social media management and CRM integration.
- Identify commercial all-in-one platforms or tightly integrated toolchains suitable for community and relationship management, focusing on plans within the $50-$100 per month price range.
- For each identified commercial tool, evaluate its specific features for community engagement, including cross-platform social media interaction tracking, contact/relationship management capabilities, and the quality of its CRM integration.
- Research prominent and well-supported open-source alternatives for community management, social media scheduling, and CRM.
-  Assess the most viable open-source options by investigating: (a) The implementation and maintenance effort to gauge if it would be a distraction for a personal project. (b) The size, activity, and collaborative nature of their user and developer communities as a potential source for partnerships and connecting with like-minded individuals.
-Compare the total cost of ownership for open-source solutions (including hosting and potential support) against the subscription fees of the commercial alternatives.
- Synthesize the findings into a detailed comparison, weighing the pros and cons of leading commercial versus open-source solutions based on their suitability for personal community building, relationship management features, cost, and ease of use.
- Formulate a final recommendation on whether a low-budget commercial tool or an open-source solution with a strong community best fits the user's goal of managing a Christ-centered fitness and wellness community effectively.

Based on an intensely critical appraisal of the material from the AI, and digging into the alternatives ... we decided that best next step would be to [rigorously evaluate Mighty Networks](https://www.mightynetworks.com/peoplemagic/masterclass/intro), a commercial platform that offers a range of features for community management, social media integration, and CRM capabilities. A 14-day trial should be sufficient for kicking the tires on this vehicle and if we push it as far as it can go in fourteen days, we will know something about the suitability of Mighty Networks for OUR project ... and even if it's not suitable, 14 days of being krausened in the Mighty Networks vat, should give a clearer picture of WHY something else would fit better OR WHY we should spend more time pushing deeper into OTHER alternatives recommended in the AI report.
