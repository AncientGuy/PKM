# Project Template

We will rely upon the GitHub Discussion and Issue functionality, BEFORE committing something to "Project" status.

Please understand the progression from ... Discussion ...to... Issue ...to... Project.

Discussions are mainly for just discussing something, to clarify terminology or ask questions or for just generally speculative thinking out loud.

Issues are for things that somebody really needs to look into and possibly turn into more of a Project.

A Project is the start of a bigger development commitment and the basis of the P.A.R.A. method of the [*Building a Second Brain* (BASB)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/category/building-a-second-brain/) methodology. The BASB method systematically manages information differently than just notetaking apps ... **PROJECTS**, have goals, reqmts and deadlines ... **AREAS** are about roles/responsibilities or obligations or capabilities that need to be earnestly developed ... **RESOURCES**, mostly finished AREAS, but also ongoing interests, assets, future inspiration, may req continual maintenance and refactoring but, for now, are *backburner*able  ... **ARCHIVES**, inactive matl from P A R that shouldn't be used, except for informational purposes.
