# FOSS Reflective Questions
These "free and open source software" questions ... for you to program you ... are designed to help you assess your current habits and identify areas for growth ... the point is not in the answer, but in pondering each answer, doing your own research and implementing your findings in your daily life. Take your time with each one, and consider journaling your thoughts or discussing them with a trusted friend or family member.

This is ONE of ten factors which are interconnected, and improving one area can positively influence others. For example, better sleep can enhance mental well-being and physical performance, while stress management can improve sleep quality. As you implement and *live* your plan, it's important to be observant, looking for the connections to all ten factors in in your own well-rounded practice ... nobody else is really going to care as much about your health as you are.

## 5) Mental Well-being

What activities do I engage in to stimulate my mind (e.g., reading, puzzles, learning new skills)?

How often do I challenge myself with new learning experiences (e.g., taking a class, picking up a hobby)?

Do I feel mentally sharp, or have I noticed any changes in memory or focus?

How does my mental stimulation (or lack thereof) affect my mood and outlook?

Am I practicing mindfulness or meditation to reduce mental clutter and enhance clarity?

How can I incorporate more mentally stimulating activities into my daily routine?

Am I open to learning new skills or hobbies that interest me (e.g., a language, instrument, or craft)?

Do I engage in conversations or debates that challenge my thinking and broaden my perspective?

How does my mental well-being impact my physical health and vice versa?

Can I find a balance between mental stimulation and relaxation to avoid burnout?
