# **Personal Knowledge Engineering (PKE) Manifesto**

This Manifesto attempts to give [an overview](#the-100-day-personal-knowledge-engineering-curriculum-overview) based on primary goals of the 100 modules in 100-day project, as well as outline the core principles of PKE systems and to explain something about what the measures of success will be for this project.  

## Primary Goals

- Articulating and embodying the goals and principles of a systematic PKE framework to accelerate autodidactic education
- Understanding the details of research at the forefront of technological innovation in various disciplines, 
- Fostering meaningful new professional connections and friendships across different disciplines in virtual venues [where people would not otherwise meet in the halls of the departments or R&D labs of their corporations],
- Enhancing the capacity to contribute to significant work in extensible open-source technologies. 
- As we learn more, we will attempt to better transform the MarkDown files used for this **mdBook** knowledgebase from a static archive or online *book* into a more dynamic, programmable publishing engine, ready for sharing, collaboration, querying and other advanced augmentation with AI. 

In summary, the core objective is to transition from the passive practice of *Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)*—the mere collection of random notes and notetaking apps—TO more actively evolving, technology-assisted discipline of ***Personal Knowledge Engineering (PKE)***. The general goal of our PKE technology is to accelerate the continuous learning and development processes, to spark new creative work, and, most importantly, to meet new friends by sharing this journey of building PKE technology to accelerate the continuous learning process in public.


## Core principles

- The extensibility of open source enables its key feature, the strengthening and deepening of the interaction in the development community surrounding an open source project.
- One learns most, best, fastest by attempting to teach others and trying to understand their learning process. People will fail to understand, fail to adopt, fail to use because the technology is inheritly failure prone, but our intention must be to learn from failure -- in fact, the principle must be to ***fail fast, in order to learn faster.*** Everything in this curriculum is an experiment intended push envelopes in order to court failure. 
- Dogfooding new technology is the best way to learn how to develop new technology and to meet people who are also serious about this objective.
- This plan adopts a ***publication-first*** methodology, which means that instead of developing a better private note-taking app, because so many excellent options already exist, the central artifact is a living, version-controlled technical book built with **mdBook**. 
- We are attempting to build something cyclonic, that means rotational inertia matters ... at first, we get the flywheel moving, then then spin the flywheel faster, but even when we struggle, we keep the flywheel spinning every day.

## Success Metrics

- At first, it's simple -- just a matter about completing today's module, while looking forward 10-20 days ahead to see how the work in this Phase sets up the next Phase ... then completing the Phase, looking at full horizon of all 100-days ahead ... thus, generally, not just looking ahead, but updating and revising the 100-module strategic curriculum, and maybe going back and correcting what should have been included in earlier modules ... with a long-term view, informed by the daily experience of showing up, rather than on temporary impatience or whim ... in other words, success of PKE system is not exactly just about how it helps only one highly experienced multi-disciplinary systems engineer, although that's enough ... hopefully, the process will help engineering new opportunities to dogfood something of greater value for others.

- The primary focus is on this PKE development journey of being much more seriously intentional about the technology of autodidactic learning and  dogfooding the technology in order to continually learn better ways to learn and **meet new colleagues who share that desire to accelerate learning**. The whole point of open source PKE technologies assembled and developed during this journey serving goes beyond the enabling toolkit, but actually uses the process of dogfooding the PKE as well as a means of meeting more colleagues and making new friendships with people who enjoy the journey of continual learning.

- Whether one is successful in the development of PKE technology will be tough to measure until after the PKE technology has been used, adopted, improved. Success along the way is a matter of just showing up every day to keep the flywheel spinning. The rotational inertia of developing the PKE technology necessarily must be transitted through the larger roadmap and staying focused on that larger picture [which will change as the PKE technology is built]. 


### **The 100-Day Personal Knowledge Engineering Curriculum Overview**

| Phase | Module Range | Core Objective | Key Deliverables |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [**Phase 1: Foundation & Systems Architecture**](1.md) | Modules 1-20 | To design and build the core infrastructure of the PKES around a publication-first, mdBook-centric workflow. | A fully configured mdBook project serving as a "personal library"; automated content pipelines; a public-facing professional identity hub. |
| [**Phase 2: Horizon Scanning & Deep Learning**](2.md) | Modules 21-50 | To systematically identify, compare, and learn emerging technologies relevant to personal and professional goals through hands-on, failure-tolerant projects documented as book chapters. | An automated tech-trend dashboard; deep-dive projects in selected domains (e.g., Generative AI, Neuromorphic Computing); refreshed mathematical foundations. |
| [**Phase 3: Creation & Contribution**](3.md) | Modules 51-80 | To translate learned knowledge into tangible public artifacts and contribute to the open-source community, using creation as a vehicle for connection. | Multiple open-source project contributions; a portfolio of projects on GitHub; published models on Hugging Face; a series of technical tutorials published in the book. |
| [**Phase 4: Connection & Synthesis**](4.md) | Modules 81-100 | To leverage the published book and other artifacts for networking, establish thought leadership, and synthesize career experience into high-value knowledge products that foster community. | A targeted networking strategy; a personal CRM built as an mdBook extension; a plan for an online tech discussion group; tools for tracking professional opportunities. |

## **Conclusion**

This 100-module curriculum provides a rigorous and systematic pathway for an experienced engineer to build a Personal Knowledge Engineering System centered on the principles of autodidacticism and community. By progressing through the four phases—Foundation, Learning, Creation, and Connection—the engineer will not only acquire skills in the most important modern technologies but will also construct a sustainable, integrated system for continuous professional growth and friendship. The emphasis on rapid, failure-tolerant experimentation, open-source contribution, and value-driven networking is designed to combat the sense of being overwhelmed by providing a clear, actionable framework. The final deliverable is more than a collection of notes and projects; it is a fully operational flywheel that transforms a lifetime of experience into a source of ongoing learning, discoverability, and meaningful connection within the global technology community.
