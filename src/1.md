# Phase 1: Foundation & Systems Architecture (Modules 1-20)**

**Objective:** To design and build the core technical and philosophical infrastructure of the Personal Knowledge Engineering System. This phase focuses on creating a robust, extensible, and future-proof "personal library" using mdBook, which will serve as the central hub for all subsequent learning, creation, and networking activities. The architectural choices made here are paramount, prioritizing open standards, data ownership, and extensibility to create a system that is not merely used, but can be actively developed and customized over time.
