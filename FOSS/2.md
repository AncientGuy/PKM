# FOSS Reflective Questions
These "free and open source software" questions ... for you to program you ... are designed to help you assess your current habits and identify areas for growth ... the point is not in the answer, but in pondering each answer, doing your own research and implementing your findings in your daily life. Take your time with each one, and consider journaling your thoughts or discussing them with a trusted friend or family member.

This is ONE of ten factors which are interconnected, and improving one area can positively influence others. For example, better sleep can enhance mental well-being and physical performance, while stress management can improve sleep quality. As you implement and *live* your plan, it's important to be observant, looking for the connections to all ten factors in in your own well-rounded practice ... nobody else is really going to care as much about your health as you are.

## 2) Strength Training

Do I currently engage in any form of strength training? If not, whatâ€™s holding me back?

How often do I perform resistance exercises (e.g., bodyweight, free weights, resistance bands)?

Am I using appropriate resistance levels for my age and fitness level to avoid injury?

Do I focus on all major muscle groups, or do I tend to neglect certain areas (e.g., core, legs)?

How can I ensure proper form to prevent injuries (e.g., working with a trainer or using mirrors)?

Am I progressively challenging myself to improve strength (e.g., increasing resistance or repetitions)?

Do I incorporate a variety of exercises to keep strength training engaging?

How does strength training make me feel physically and mentally?

Am I allowing enough rest and recovery between strength sessions?

Can I find a workout buddy or group to make strength training more enjoyable?
