# FOSS Reflective Questions
These "free and open source software" questions ... for you to program you ... are designed to help you assess your current habits and identify areas for growth ... the point is not in the answer, but in pondering each answer, doing your own research and implementing your findings in your daily life. Take your time with each one, and consider journaling your thoughts or discussing them with a trusted friend or family member.

This is ONE of ten factors which are interconnected, and improving one area can positively influence others. For example, better sleep can enhance mental well-being and physical performance, while stress management can improve sleep quality. As you implement and *live* your plan, it's important to be observant, looking for the connections to all ten factors in in your own well-rounded practice ... nobody else is really going to care as much about your health as you are.

## A) Balance and Coordination

How confident am I in my balance and coordination during daily activities?

Do I engage in activities that challenge my balance (e.g., standing on one leg, balance board)?

Am I aware of any decline in my balance or coordination over time?

How often do I practice balance exercises (e.g., tai chi, yoga, specific drills)?

Do I feel unsteady when walking, climbing stairs, or navigating uneven surfaces?

How does improving balance affect my risk of falls and overall independence?

Am I aware of any environmental factors (e.g., clutter, poor lighting) that could impact my balance?

Can I incorporate balance exercises into my existing routine (e.g., while brushing teeth or watching TV)?

How can I make balance training more engaging (e.g., trying new activities, setting small goals)?

How does maintaining good balance contribute to my long-term mobility and confidence?
