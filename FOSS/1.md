# FOSS Reflective Questions
These "free and open source software" questions ... for you to program you ... are designed to help you assess your current habits and identify areas for growth ... the point is not in the answer, but in pondering each answer, doing your own research and implementing your findings in your daily life. Take your time with each one, and consider journaling your thoughts or discussing them with a trusted friend or family member.

This is ONE of ten factors which are interconnected, and improving one area can positively influence others. For example, better sleep can enhance mental well-being and physical performance, while stress management can improve sleep quality. As you implement and *live* your plan, it's important to be observant, looking for the connections to all ten factors in in your own well-rounded practice ... nobody else is really going to care as much about your health as you are.

## 1) Mobility and Flexibility

How often do I stretch or engage in flexibility exercises?

Do I experience stiffness or limited range of motion in any joints?

Have I tried yoga or tai chi before? If not, am I open to exploring them?

How can I incorporate more stretching into my daily routine (e.g., after waking up or before bed)?

Are there specific areas of my body that need more attention for flexibility (e.g., hips, shoulders)?

Do I warm up properly before exercise and cool down afterward?

How does my flexibility compare to when I was younger, and how does that affect my daily activities?

Am I aware of any muscle imbalances that could impact my mobility?

Do I sit for long periods? If so, how can I incorporate more movement throughout the day?

How can I make stretching a more enjoyable part of my routine (e.g., pairing it with music or a podcast)?
