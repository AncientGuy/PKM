# Ancient Guy

***Really knowing your very most essential WHY*** ... really understanding the UNIQUE reason for your existence ... is about a UNIQUE, personal lifelong quest ... the reason for this quest is to [be able to get over your damned ego with all of its accumulated baggage and inebriating poison and to begin to let your most essential WHY come out in your existence](https://kidadl.com/quotes/best-meister-eckhart-quotes-from-the-german-monist-philosopher).

***Knowing the Origins of your most original origins*** is what the genuinely old school Ancient Guy lifestyle is about ... it is a necessarily a mystical and very personal quest. It is a quest which could be *defined* as the quest to know one's Creator, to know one's God. Other's might have some sort of linguistic, semantic or pathological psychic hang-ups with the word "God" but this quest has absolutely NOTHING to do with religous beliefs ... it is more fundamental than peer-pressure, more fundamental than religion. It is unique and PERSONAL.

The Ancient Guy life is fundamentally very old school, ancient, cold, hard quest for the very most essential and absolute WHY of one's existence. It is fundmentally about the attempt to pierce the ego and get past ALL of accumulated mental baggage of one's existence. Hopefully, it should be obvious enough that **this mystical quest is not for sissies** or people who are addicted to fantasies and comfort. It is not for those who have just swallowed regurgitated intellectual baby food for their entire lives. But is also not about [*seeing the face of God*](https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/33-20.html), but it is about recognizing the face of God in the lives and world around us. The quest for the most essential WHY is the quest to see the fabric of Reality as it really is, not as we might hope or wish that it might be ... it will, at times, be fundamentally disconcerting -- so it is only for those who are sufficiently bathed in love so that they can endure the extreme discomfort of some very cold truths.

***Knowing your your very most essential WHY*** ... the UNIQUE reason for your existence ... is about your UNIQUE quest for the fundamental truths of your existence ... and that includes the saving grace of your spiritual salvation or the *reason* [if such a word as "reason" can possible apply here] for why/how your soul can be eternal.


In modern parlance, the Ancient Guy lifestyle involves working on the code of the very barest of [bare-metal operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine) in every sense of one's existence. 

Thus, it's NOT about settling for a hacked-together collection of passed-down superstitious religous beliefs ... NOT about just going along blindly with old inherited assumptions and unquestioned suppositions ... NOT about longing for the rear-view mirror of childhood with comforting old cartoons and pop-psych fantasies which tend dominate the noise governing the modern dystopian mind .... the Ancient Guy lifestyle is a about a life that represents the quest for the most essential, most valuable, deepest root of the root cause of one's existence ... it is ***a fundamentally mystical life dedicated to the search of that very most essential WHY.*** 

## Stop EVER Blaming Others

The fundamental paradox of the personal quest for antiracism is to channel the HATRED of every personal encounter with racism and the HATRED of the sin of judgement by outward appearances into the energy and drive to FIGHT hate ... to never give in to hate ... to NEVER ever judge by outward appearances ... to entirely STOP ever tolerating the typical idoiocy of placing any blame on others.  Stop EVER blaming others -- because you cannot possibly hope to fix doomed souls who insist on judging based on outward appearance -- the ONLY way that you can judge is from what you KNOW, from what is within rather than what is external.

Of course, EVIL does exist ... you will need to be ready to KILL evil when you are attacked, but to pre-meditate and carry out an attack on something that you have **wrongfully** judged (ie ALL judgement based on outward appearances is WRONG) to be EVIL is something that you will be judged and punished for.  *"Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord.* means that your role is to LET GO and refuse to allow any kind of hate or other judgmental bullshit live rent-free in your mind ... *when you tend your garden of HATE, it will take over every last thing that you possess.* ***Stop EVER Blaming Others***
