description: Seeing beyond Time involves realizing that the ORIGIN of all Origins is defined as God. A matter of DEFINITION, not belief. God IS Everywhere. God is not some nice Old Man, not our servant, not some superhero, not some anthropomorphized quasi-equal that'll will invite us to the club so we can say we had dinner with God. In this Time-bound existence, humans are trapped by their egos, unable to escape the Timebound notions of their existence. Thus, humans unable to see why they must work harder at loving others as they love themselves, not simply as some commandment to do that without realizing why, but in order to escape the pathetic selfish timebound me-ness of their finite existence. The Creator always WAS, always IS, always WILL BE ... the Kingdom of Heavan is at hand, not something that is coming in the future. Your death is the only thing that is coming in the future. Everything dies. Everyone that remembers any evidence of your existence or your species existence will die. Everything will return to the precursors of the Creator's dust. There is no such thing as genuine permanence in the manner that humans are able to concieve of permanence. Luke 17:20;
